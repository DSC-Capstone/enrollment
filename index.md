## Overview

Welcome to the capstone program! The capstone program is a two-quarter sequence (Fall 2025 and Winter 2026) in which you will be mentored by a faculty member or industry expert in their domain of expertise. By the end of Quarter 2, you will design and execute a project from that domain in teams. You can see the projects from last year at [**dsc-capstone.org/showcase-25**](https://dsc-capstone.org/showcase-25).


At a high level, here‚Äôs how the capstone program is organized:
- In Quarter 1 (DSC 180A), you gain background information in your mentor‚Äôs domain, by means of replicating a known result. By the end of Quarter 1, you will have completed a replication project (known as the ‚ÄúQuarter 1 Project‚Äù) and will have a proposal for a more independent project (known as the ‚ÄúQuarter 2 Project‚Äù, or the capstone project).
- In Quarter 2 (DSC 180B), you execute the Quarter 2 Project you proposed at the end of Quarter 1.

## Enrollment

First pass for enrollment will begin soon. The available domains are **not** listed on the Schedule of Classes; instead, they are detailed [**below**](#toc). Most domains are run by UCSD faculty, but some are run by industry partners (denoted with an <span class="badge-industry">Industry Partner</span> badge).

Use the information here to choose the domain you'd like to enroll in. Once you've chosen a domain, all you need to do is enroll in the corresponding discussion section for DSC 180A once registration is open, space permitting. Note that you cannot change domains between DSC 180A and DSC 180B.

All of the information here ‚Äì domain offerings, section times, descriptions, summer tasks, etc. ‚Äì is subject to change as mentors provide us with more information.

<!--{: .important }
**As of this writing (Wednesday, May 22nd at 1PM), the section sizes in the Schedule of Classes haven't yet been updated. Trust the information here, not there.** -->

### How should I choose a domain?

You should aim to choose a domain that suits your interests and preparation. By clicking the <a><b>Read more</b></a> button underneath a domain, you'll get to learn more about the mentor, their mentoring style, the prerequisites that they'd like their students to have, tasks that they'd like their students to work on over the summer, and their students' capstone projects in previous years (if any).

‚úÖ <span style="color:#00bb00"><b>Good</b></span> reasons to choose a domain:
- You are sufficiently prepared.
- You find the topic interesting and would be motivated to study it.
- You are likely to work well with the mentor given their mentoring style and research background.

‚ùå <span style="color:#ff0000"><b>Bad</b></span> reasons to choose a domain:
- The mentor has good teaching evaluations.
- The industry partner is a big company.
- The section has space for you and your friends at a time that you like.

Everything you produce for the capstone will have to be public on the internet for the rest of eternity with you and your mentor's names attached to it ‚Äì you want your capstone work to be something that you're proud of and can talk about on job and graduate school applications. Who do you want writing you a recommendation letter?

### What happens in DSC 180A?

In addition to meeting with your mentor each week, there will also be methodology instruction delivered by the capstone coordinator and the methodology course staff. However, the majority of this instruction will occur asynchronously, in the form of readings (like [this one](https://dsc-capstone.org/2024-25/lessons/01/)). **This means that you can mostly ignore the lecture and lab times that appear for DSC 180A on the Schedule of Classes.** A few of the lecture slots may be used for the capstone coordinator's office hours or for one-off guest lectures, but we don't plan to use the majority of the times.

All prerequisites for DSC 180A will be strictly enforced. The prerequisites for DSC 180A can be found [**here**](https://datascience.ucsd.edu/current-students/course-descriptions-and-prerequisites/#dsc-180a-data-science-project-1). If you took either DSC 140A, DSC 140B, or DSC 148 to satisfy the machine learning prerequisite, you may need to submit an [Enrollment Authorization System](https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/Modules/Students/PreAuth/) request in order to enroll in DSC 180A in fall quarter.

Note that since DSC 180A and DSC 180B are both 4-unit courses, you should expect to spend 12 hours a week on capstone-related work each quarter. Plan your class schedule accordingly ‚Äì try not to take several time-consuming classes alongside the capstone.

### Who is overseeing the capstone?

With any questions about the capstone sequence itself, feel free to email Umesh Bellur (ubellur@ucsd.edu) for now. 

With any questions about the content of a particular domain, contact the mentor. With any questions about enrollment, please contact Student Affairs in the VAC.

title: HCI and Reinforcement Learning for Hearing Loss Compensation
bio: |
  I run a lab at UCSD that conducts fundamental and translational research at the intersection of Technology, Healthcare, and Education -- THELab.  
  I am the Founder/CEO of Nadi Inc, a California C-Corp that commercializes translational research in academia.  
  We are launching "breakthrough" Hearing Aids using a SaaS model, in time for the 2025 Holiday season.  
  My interest in volunteering to mentor DSC Capstone is to solve the hard problems in the area of Hearing Aids, and restore the function of our ability to communicate in a natural language.

  HCI: Improve the user interfaces for the hearing impaired using GUI, Voice User Interfaces, and Gesture-based Interfaces.  
  Reinforcement: Balancing Exploration and Exploitation constrained by available (but growing) feedback data from users.

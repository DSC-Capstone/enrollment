title: Design Machine Learning Methods that are Scalable, Effective, and Come with Provable Guarantees
bio: "Associate Professor at HDSI, affiliated with CSE.  Research focuses on statistical machine learning,  differential privacy, reinforcement learning, optimization and all kinds of applications. Recently, I am most excited about theory of deep learning and watermarking large language models.  An ideal undergraduate project would be one that investigates a particular applied problem with a concrete dataset available using techniques develops from my lab. "
description: "My research interest is broad, but I prefer students explore either of the following two domains.<br><br>

Domain 1:  Differentially private data science.  Many data science problems involve handling sensitive data of individual subjects.  Even if the personal identifiable informations (PIIs) are removed, individuals can still be re-identified using the output ML models, its predictions and even merely summary statistics --- especially when combined with side information.   While the theory of private learning is well-developed, other important aspects of data science, e.g.,  data-preprocessing, missing-data imputation and model selection are less explored. The research problem may involve developing new differentially private methods for these tasks and conducting end-to-end data analysis tasks on specific applied problems, e.g., predicting disease using electronic patient records or controlling blood glucose level for diabetes patients.

Domain 2: Evaluation and Attack on LLM watermarks.   Watermarking is a promising approach towards addressing the LLM abuse. It injects subtle statistical signals in the LLM generated text that makes it detectable when a secret key is given.  However, the statistical signal can be weakened or even removed if the generated text is edited, paraphrased or otherwise post-processed.    The general scope of this project is to come up with practical attacks on existing watermarking schemes so as to evaluate how useful they are in practice.
"
summer: "Working on the above prerequisites. Reading papers. Watching my recorded lectures."
oldstudent: nan
prerequisites: Knowing statistics and optimization theory will help with reading technical papers from my group.  For projects that involves coding and experimentation,  it is important for the student to have taken a first course in data structures and algorithms. 
time: Friday Morning, In-Person
style: Each project will have a PhD student mentor assigned who will offer additional office hours each week.   Students will be able to reach the faculty and graduate student mentors on Slack too.    To make the weekly session effective, students are expected to devote time to complete independent work each week.

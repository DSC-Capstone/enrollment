title: "Sepsis â€” Using Clinical Healthcare Data Science to Identify and Combat an Infectious Killer"
bio: |
  Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Kyle Shannon, as a professional in the public health and data science fields, I am dedicated to improving healthcare accessibility and enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in rural America. My journey began at UCSD, where I studied in the CogSci department as an undergraduate and discovered my passion for Data Science when it was still an emerging field (2013). I later pursued my master's degree in Data Science at UCSD, and eventually co-founded a startup focused on healthcare access. My enthusiasm lies in data science projects that directly impact patient health outcomes, and I maintain a keen interest in cognitive neuroscience and tiny ML systems. Outside of work, you can find me on a tennis court or delighting in the ambiance of a cozy cafe while tackling projects.

  Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by the bodyâ€™s extreme response to an infection. Early detection and intervention are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This project aims to develop a radiographic-enhanced clinical decision support system for early sepsis detection and risk assessment.

  The system leverages chest X-ray images and patient metadata to predict the probability of sepsis development within specific time frames after the X-ray is taken. The proposed pipeline consists of two main components:  
  1) A ResNet model that predicts lung anomalies based solely on chest X-ray images  
  2) A CatBoost model that combines the output of the first model with patient vitals and other relevant metadata to predict whether the patient is at risk of sepsis.

  The project involves extensive data engineering to preprocess and integrate the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets.

  The following are recommended summer domain readings and tasks. Getting through some or all of these, especially if you are a bit unfamiliar with the domain, would be a good idea and help you hit the ground running in the fall. I will be available during the summer to meet with you as a group once or twice if you wish.

  For clarity, during the summer, the three areas I recommend focusing on would be:
  - Familiarizing yourself with EHR data  
  - Learning about the MIMIC dataset  
  - Beginning to understand a bit more about clinical critical care in an ICU
time: Thursdays 1:30â€“2:30 PM

  My goal is to create a capstone experience that emulates a practical "job" setting, guiding students in effectively interacting with managers and data science leads, asking relevant questions, and fulfilling their responsibilities. I may assume various roles (e.g., DS lead, stakeholder, hospital admin, manager) to offer diverse perspectives. I incorporate a business angle to discuss the project's broader context, encouraging students to envision their work in scenarios such as product development or hospital consultancy. This approach helps them grasp real-world applications and develop a compelling narrative for their projects.

  I prioritize accessibility for my students throughout the week, for example, via Discord, and may involve domain experts for them to interview and learn from professionals in ICUs and EHR data. This context adds valuable insight and humanizes the data/system. I often hold informal meetings with my students over coffee to discuss progress and answer questions. Occasionally, I expect them to provide progress reports and mini-presentations, simulating a real-world organizational experience.

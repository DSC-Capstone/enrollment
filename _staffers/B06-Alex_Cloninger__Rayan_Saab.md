title: Analysis of Temporally Varying Point Cloud using Optimal Transport
bio: |
  Alex Cloninger is an Associate Professor in Mathematics and the Halicioglu Data Science Institute. He works on computational models for learning similarities between data, and using these similarity measures to solve various scientific problems. 

  Rayan Saab is a Professor in the Mathematics Department and at the Halicioglu Data Science Institute. He works on developing computational methods and theory for solving problems related to collecting, processing, and analyzing data. He came to this work first through an undergrad degree in electrical engineering and finding himself always interested in both making things work and understanding why they do.

  Time varying point clouds appear in a number of important applications. These range from Motion Capture (MOCAP) data, to molecular and particle dynamics, to crowd and swarm dynamics. In these applications, each "datum" of interest is a multi-dimensional time series of a large number of points over a long number of time steps, and the questions associated are how to cluster and classify these data, or how to generate new examples. Unfortunately, analysis of these problems can be quite complex. Fundamentally, this boils down to three issues:  
  1) lack of point-to-point registration from one time scale to a later time,  
  2) the lack of time series tools for dealing with high dimensional time series, especially when the data is not in a simple Euclidean vector space, and  
  3) the sheer size of the data storage / computation for just one time series example.

  The domain of this project will cover methods in comparing these point clouds as coming from distributions that are time varying, and thinking about analysis of these distributions. One tool we will use for these analyses is optimal transport, which can benefit the problem both theoretically and computationally. We will also consider deep learning and signal processing approaches to these types of data. Students who choose this project will delve into the mathematical and computational problems of these data types, utilizing tools from probability and statistics, signal processing, and linear algebra. They will also engage in hands-on coding and experimentation on algorithms for optimal transport and time series models, testing them on various data sets.

  Here are some relevant readings / videos. Students need not go into the mathematical details as we can go through them together, but these papers give an idea of the different approaches and applications. The more familiar you are with the topic, the more we can do!

  To be able to obtain really nice experimental results, you'll need to pick up PyTorch and also the POT: Python Optimal Transport toolbox.
time: Mondays 2-3pm
ta: TBA
modality: In-person (need room booked for me; required if mentoring >4 students in-person)
style: |
  We both are relatively hands-on in the sense that we make ourselves available for problem-solving and discussions. That said, students have to be self-motivated, and motivated to do the readings and the work.

title: Simulation coding exercises for teaching probability theory
bio: |
  I received my PhD from the Department of Biostatistics at the University of Washington. My primary research focus is statistical phylogenetics, with secondary interests in statistics education and in casino games of chance. Prior to joining the faculty at HDSI, I was an Associate Professor of Statistics at Villanova University -- the alma mater of one pope and three future NBA champions (I am writing this on May 17th 2025 as the NY Knicks have just won their Eastern Conference Semifinal series, and I'm calling it now).

  Within the past two decades, simulation-based inference has established itself as a standard approach for teaching an introductory statistics or data science course (such as DSC 10). While it has been argued that simulation-based pedagogies should likewise be useful in a probability theory course, the implementation therein is not currently well developed, nor is this notion even universally accepted to date. Students in this domain will explore this by developing coding exercises that are designed to teach concepts from a typical undergraduate probability theory course (such as MATH 180A, MATH 183, and MATH 181A). Specifically, the coding exercises that capstone students in this domain will create as part of their projects will task probability students with writing simulation code that illustrates a particular concept or theoretical result in a probability course. Possible deliverables at the end of projects in this domain could be each of the following, or other related/comparable items proposed by capstone students in this domain: (1) a set of coding exercises that each target a specific topic in a probability theory course; (2) instructor lesson notes for each coding exercise that details how it could be implemented in a typical course and its pedagogical rationale (i.e. why we believe it should be effective); (3) solutions to each coding exercise, in both R and Python; (4) Shiny apps (written in either R or Python) for each coding exercise that visually and interactively demonstrate the solution code in action; (5) assessment questions to test students on their resulting understanding of the probability concepts aimed to be taught by each of the coding exercises, and their answers; (6) statistical analyses on data collected via a designed experiment by capstone students, directly investigating the efficacy of their created coding exercises for teaching probability concepts. Capstone students in this domain should plan to take the CITI Human Subjects Research training: Social and Behavioral Research, administered online (and at no cost) by the UCSD IRB office, early in Quarter 1 in preparation for collection of real data for item (6) above during Quarter 2.

  (1) Review concepts from whichever probability course(s) that you have taken; (2) Explore the Shiny apps here to get an idea of what is possible with Shiny apps for teaching statistics: https://statistics.calpoly.edu/shiny; (3) Read this paper (although its aims were different from what ours will be, it is one of the only scientific research papers to date that addresses the idea of using simulation in a probability theory course, so it will be good to be familiar with what they have done and the issues that they raise): https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10691898.2019.1600387

  I will mentor this domain solo (without assistance from graduate students). I aim to give students the background and confidence to take ownership over their projects, and will likely be fairly hands-on at first: in particular, I will lead discussions on concepts in the field of statistics education, and give instruction on how to write Shiny apps as needed. I will also cover principles of experimental design and relevant statistical analyses as needed.

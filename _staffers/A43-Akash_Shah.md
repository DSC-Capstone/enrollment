bio: |
  Lisa Li is an AI/Data Scientist at Intuit, excited to mentor UCSD students in tackling industry-level challenges. With seven years of experience spanning the insurance sector and now tech at Intuit, she specializes in applying Deep Learning, Time Series models, and LLM models to create impactful solutions. Lisa holds a Master's degree in Data Science from GSU and a Bachelor's in Math from UCLA, and is eager to guide students through developing and deploying data-driven models that address real-world business problems.

  Borchau Juang’s professional role at Intuit involves AI research and development, specifically focusing on AI/ML solutions to enhance customer success within the Virtual Expert Platform (VEP). This encompasses the development of Large Language Model (LLM) applications for the extraction of expert knowledge, the refinement of issue resolution processes through agentic AI workflows, and the construction of recommendation systems to optimize customer routing and matchmaking.

  Pratyush Panda is a Machine Learning Engineer at Intuit with over three years of experience in his current role. He brings a wealth of experience from previous machine learning engineering positions at Samsung Electronics America and Informatica. His expertise includes machine learning, Python, and Artificial Intelligence (AI), with a background in developing and deploying AI/ML solutions. Pratyush holds a Master of Science in Computer Science from California State University - East Bay.

  Victor Calderon is a Machine Learning Engineer at Intuit, specializing in Generative AI and LLMs. An astrophysicist-turned-data-scientist, he focuses on applying Generative AI solutions to customer-related problems. Prior to Intuit, Victor developed and deployed computer vision models and MLOps pipelines at 5x5 Technologies Inc. He holds a Ph.D. in Physics with a focus on computational astrophysics from Vanderbilt University.

  The challenge of workforce management in customer-facing operations centers on effectively aligning staffing levels with fluctuating customer demand across diverse interaction channels. This problem space involves not only forecasting incoming customer volumes but also determining the optimal allocation of personnel, often referred to as headcount forecasting, to meet predefined service objectives.

  A significant complexity arises from the need to consider various operational constraints, such as target response times (e.g., Average Speed to Answer), average interaction durations (e.g., Average Handle Time), and overarching service level agreements. Furthermore, the relationship between customer demand types and the staff groups capable of handling them is often intricate, featuring many-to-many mappings where a single staff group might service multiple demand categories, and a single demand category might be serviceable by several different staff groups, each with potentially varying skill sets and efficiencies.

  The core goal is to ensure adequate staffing to meet demand effectively while optimizing resource utilization and maintaining service quality.

  We plan to take an engaged but student-led approach to mentoring. We’ll work closely with the students throughout the project – meeting regularly, providing guidance, and being available for feedback and support. We’re also looking for students that can take ownership of their learning and direction, and can execute on the feedback provided. We’ll help them think critically, problem-solve, and communicate their process and outcomes clearly. Outside of the set office hours, we will do our best to respond to any inquiries within 48 hours, ideally sooner.

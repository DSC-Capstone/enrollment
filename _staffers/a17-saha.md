bio: "Director of the National NSF TRIPODS Institute for Emerging CORE Methods in Data Science (EnCORE)<br>

The Harry E. Gruber Endowed Chair Professor of Computer Science and Information Technologies, University of California San Diego<br>

Department of Computer Science & Engineering, and Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute<br>

Previously, I was a tenured Associate Professor at the University of California Berkeley, and even before that on the faculty of Computer Science at UMass Amherst, and as a Senior Research Scientist at the AT&T Shannon Research Laboratory. I am also an Affiliate faculty of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing at UC Berkeley."

# summer: "Read: <ul>
# <li>A recent example of a perturbation-based audit study: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14875</li>
# <li>Our recent paper on why audits must be community-centered and how this kind of auditing relates to democratic governance: https://escholarship.org/content/qt6r820956/qt6r820956.pdf</li>
# <li>For more readings, see: https://auditlab.stuartgeiger.com</li>
# <li>Take UCSD/CITI IRB Human Subject Protection Training online course (Social and Behavioral Basic), must complete by week 3 of Fall, but good to do it earlier. Register at citiprogram.org and see this video for how to register: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hOAgfK93QXg</li>
# <li>Get familiar with OpenAI API and ollama (https://ollama.com/) for self-hosted open-source LLMs (which uses OpenAI API schema)</li></ul><br>"
# oldstudent: https://dsc180b.lojot.com/
# prerequisites: Base data science prereqs are sufficient (we won't dive deep into foundations of LLMs or causal inference). We will be talking and listening to people (especially strangers) and serving as their ad-hoc consultants. Skills in consulting, volunteering, tabling for student orgs, etc. are not required, but will be useful -- and you will build those skills if you do not have them.
time: Tuesday Morning, Zoom
ta: Zimo Wang
# style: I will be the point of contact and there every week, but may bring in collaborators and my grad student advisees. I intentionally do not run a "lab", but I do have a "constellation of collaboration." Students can choose their own particular context in which LLMs are deployed and which kinds of community members / impacted people they want to consult.

title: Data Valuation & Curation for Trustworthy AI
bio: |
  Babak Salimi is an Assistant Professor in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. His research lies at the intersection of data management and machine learning, with a focus on building reliable, safe, and robust data-driven systems. He develops methods and tools that enhance the transparency and dependability of algorithmic decision-making, empowering practitioners to make informed and confident choices.

  Modern machine-learning pipelines increasingly live or die on data decisions—what to keep, what to toss, what to label next, and how much each record is “worth.” This domain surveys the growing toolkit of data-valuation and data-centric AI methods—Data Shapley (ICML 2019), influence functions, MMD/Wasserstein-based coresets, active-learning and subset-selection heuristics—that assign a quantitative score to every example’s marginal impact on model accuracy, robustness, and privacy risk. We’ll examine how those scores power practical tasks such as pruning noisy or duplicated records, budgeting scarce labeling effort, spotting harmful outliers, and auditing publicly released datasets. Students will dive into open benchmarks like WILDS (https://wilds.stanford.edu/) for distribution shifts and the DataPerf challenges (https://dataperf.org/) for curation leaderboards, replicate baseline valuation techniques in Quarter 1, and use the insights—and gaps—they uncover to propose original data-selection or curation projects for Quarter 2.

  Readings — to ground everyone in core data-valuation methods:  
  • “Data Shapley: Equitable Valuation of Data for Machine Learning” (ICML 2019)  
  • “LAVA: Data Valuation without Pre-Specified Learning Algorithms” (ICLR 2023)  
  • “Adversarial Attacks on Data Valuation” (NeurIPS 2024)  

  Hands-on — pick one:  
  Clone the LAVA GitHub repo and run the quick-start script on a small UCI dataset, producing a ranked list of data values.
time: Friday 3:00 – 4:00 PM PT

  Capstone students will operate as an independent cohort: we will meet for a dedicated one-hour session each week where I lead mini-lectures, paper discussions, and milestone check-ins. While my PhD students are not formally part of the section, I may occasionally invite them to hold optional office-hour–style drop-ins for coding or tooling questions. I’ll be hands-on during project framing, data wrangling, and experimental design, then step back so teams can drive their own experiments and insights, checking progress and providing strategic guidance every week.

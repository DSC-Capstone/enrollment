title: Large Language (Multi-Modal) Model Reasoners and Agents
bio: |
  Zhiting Hu is an Assistant Professor in Halicioglu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. He received his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2014, and his Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. His research interests lie in the broad area of machine learning and artificial intelligence, with a focus on principles, methodologies, and systems of building AI agents that learn and reason with efficiency and generality. His current work centers on building general world models for next-generation machine reasoning and unified learning mechanisms for training machines with all types of experience. His research was recognized with outstanding paper awards at ACL 2016 and ACL 2024, and best demo nominations at ACL 2019 and NAACL 2024.

  A central topic in Large Language or Multi-Modal Model research is to enhance their ability of complex reasoning on diverse problems. Rich research has been done to generate multi-step reasoning chains with LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT), Reasoning-via-Planning (RAP), OpenAI o-series, etc. This capstone aims to explore the diverse reasoning approaches of LLMs (and/or large multi-modal models) and investigate improvement, applications, and scalable implementations of these approaches. For example:  
  (1) Proposing new reasoning algorithms or improvement over existing reasoning algorithms in terms of performance;  
  (2) Developing algorithmic and/or system innovations to scale up existing advanced reasoning algorithms;  
  (3) Developing new agent frameworks for various applications like deep research, AI scientists, real-world embodied and social agents, etc.

  Students can either join the mentor's research group to work closely with PhD students/postdocs on relevant projects, or propose their own ideas and lead the projects. Students are expected to be independent, and mentor will provide necessary advices if needed (PhD students/postdocs can also provide more hands-on guidances).

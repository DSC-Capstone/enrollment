title: Multivariate Prediction from Human Brain Functional MRI Data
bio: "With an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, I discovered statistics for my PhD and have been doing data science since then (even when it wasn't called by that name). Much of my work involves signal and image analysis, but I'm interested in many theoretical and applied problems, even philosophical. Outside of academia, I like doing music, dancing, swimming, surfing, and more."
description: "Multivariate prediction from functional MRI is a technique for understanding how brain activation patterns map to thoughts or experiences, akin to mind reading. Instead of analyzing brain regions in isolation, this approach considers how joint patterns of activity distributed across the brain can predict psychological or clinical outcomes. In this capstone project, we will learn how to 1) work with neuroimaging data in Python, 2) select informative features, and 3) train models using supervised machine learning. We will focus on interpretability and think about how the model parameters might help us better understand the relationship between brain structure and function."
summer: "To start, we will replicate the results from the Haxby paper that introduced this method: Distributed and Overlapping Representations of Faces and Objects in Ventral Temporal Cortex (link: http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/16-899A/2014_spring/thevisualworld/HaxbyPietrini2001Science.pdf). Reading material:
<ul>
<li>Background on Functional MRI: Chapters 2, 5, 9, 10 from Handbook of Functional MRI Data Analysis (link: https://www.cs.mtsu.edu/~xyang/fMRIHandBook.pdf)</li>
<li>Multivariate Prediction Tutorial (link: https://dartbrains.org/content/Multivariate_Prediction.html)</li>
<li>Introduction to Nilearn Tutorials (link: https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/00_tutorials/index.html)</li>
<li>Nilearn Tutorial on Replicating the Haxby Result (link: https://nilearn.github.io/stable/auto_examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_different_estimators.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-02-decoding-plot-haxby-different-estimators-py)</li></ul>"
oldstudent: https://andrewcheng02.github.io/DSC180B-Capstone-ProjectA09/docs/
prerequisites: Probability and Statistics (e.g. CSE 103, ECE 109, MATH 180A, MATH 183, MATH 189)
time: Wednesday 3:30-4:30PM, In-Person
style: Mentoring will involve data science PhD student Gabriel Riegner. Students are expected to take ownership over the project. This implies taking initiative in learning about the topic (from the assigned material and other sources), implementing the methods in code, being resourceful when needing help, and asking questions. Students are expected to put in their best effort, plan their time over the quarter, make substantial progress each week, report on it each week, and come up with an action plan for the next steps (as opposed to waiting for the mentor to give instructions). In other words, be independent and ask for help when needed.

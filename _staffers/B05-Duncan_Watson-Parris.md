title: Deep Learning for Climate Model Emulation
bio: |
  Duncan Watson-Parris is an atmospheric physicist working at the interface of climate research and machine learning. The Climate Analytics Lab (CAL) he leads focuses on understanding the interactions between aerosols and clouds, and their representation within global climate models. CAL is leading the development of a variety of machine learning tools and techniques to optimally combine a variety of observational datasets, including global satellite and aircraft measurements, to constrain and improve these models. Duncan is also keen to foster the application of machine learning to climate science questions more broadly and convenes the Machine Learning for Climate Science EGU session and co-convenes the “AI and Climate Science” discovery series that is part of the United Nations’ AI for Good program.

  The choices humanity makes in the next few decades will determine how much warmer the Earth will be by the end of the century, with implications for billions of lives and trillions of dollars in GDP. Many different emission pathways exist that are compatible with the Paris climate agreement, and many more are possible that miss that target. While some of the most complex climate models have simulated a small selection of these, it is impractical to use these computationally expensive models to fully explore the space of possibilities or assess all the associated risks. 

  Our lab has recently developed state-of-the-art climate model emulators to enable fast, accurate and reliable predictions for any given scenario (https://github.com/duncanwp/ClimateBench). This project will extend this work by incorporating multiple climate models at different levels of fidelity to provide high-resolution predictions with robust uncertainties for improved decision making.
summer: |
  - Skim the latest UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Synthesis Report to get a summary of the latest climate change science, especially the figures: https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf  
  - Read the ClimateBench paper: https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021MS002954  
  - Try out the xarray Python library for working with climate data: https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/
time: Wednesday 2-3pm
ta: TBA
modality: In-person (need room booked for me; required if mentoring >4 students in-person)
style: |
  This work is central to CAL so I will meet personally with the students, and it can be integrated into the broader research program to the extent the students want to engage with it. The students will be welcome to join our Lab meetings (typically held at Scripps Institution of Oceanography).

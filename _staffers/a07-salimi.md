title: "Data-Centric AI: Data Quality Management for Improved Fairness, Robustness, and Accuracy in Predictive Modeling"
bio: "My research interests focus on advancing the field of trustworthy data analysis by fostering responsible data management practices. I am deeply passionate about data management, as I believe that having reliable, accessible, and well-organized data is crucial for establishing trust in data-driven decision-making. My research aims to create methods that promote transparency, fairness, reliability, and robustness in algorithmic decision-making processes. By adopting a data management-centric approach, I strive to develop tools and techniques that empower human decision-makers to interpret data more accurately and confidently. In my research group, we are committed to creating tools that support decision-makers from diverse backgrounds in understanding data and making more informed choices. Our goal is to enable better decision-making by bridging the gap between complex data and human understanding, ultimately fostering trust in data analysis."
description: "In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, the integrity and quality of data play pivotal roles in determining the effectiveness and ethical impact of AI systems. This domain focuses on the critical need for Data Quality Management in AI, specifically aimed at enhancing fairness, robustness, and accuracy in algorithmic decisions. As AI technologies become increasingly integrated into various sectors—ranging from healthcare to finance—the demand for models that not only perform consistently across diverse conditions but also maintain equitable outcomes is paramount. Students exploring this domain will delve into methodologies and strategies to assess, refine, and augment data quality. By investigating how data anomalies, biases, and inconsistencies affect model performance, students will be equipped to propose innovative solutions that ensure AI systems are both technically sound and socially responsible. The ultimate goal is to prepare students to develop AI applications that are capable of standing up to real-world challenges and ethical scrutiny, making them valuable across different industries and societal contexts."

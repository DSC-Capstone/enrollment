title: "Sepsis: Using Clinical Healthcare Data Science to Identify and Combat an Infectious Killer"
bio: "Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Kyle Shannon, as a professional in the public health and data science fields, I am dedicated to improving healthcare accessibility and enhancing patient outcomes, particularly in rural America. My journey began at UCSD, where I studied in the CogSci department as an undergraduate and discovered my passion for Data Science when it was still an emerging field (2012). I later pursued my master's degree in Data Science at UCSD, and eventually co-founded a startup focused on healthcare access in rural America. My enthusiasm lies in data science projects that directly impact patient health outcomes, and I maintain a keen interest in cognitive neuroscience and CNN ML systems in healthcare (my masters' thesis). Outside of work, you can find me on a tennis court or shrouded in the ambiance of a cozy cafe while tackling projects... preferably while it is raining."
description: "Students will explore the world of inpatient ICU care by examining severe infection management and detection using the MIMIC dataset, a comprehensive, publicly available database of de-identified ICU patient data. This project will familiarize participants with healthcare data nuances and the critical role EHRs (Electronic Health Records) play in clinical decision-making. Through this experience, students will gain insights into the broader context of clinical decision-making and public health, learning to leverage EHRs and clinical data science for developing potential products, reports, and or health policies. They will better understand the US healthcare system, ICU operations, and the decision-making process for complex infectious cases like sepsis. By studying the work of multidisciplinary teams, students will gain a deeper understanding of intricate ICU cases and the patients' journeys through this challenging healthcare landscape. Additionally, they will appreciate the complexities of conducting data science in a demanding environment."
summer: "The following are recommended summer domain readings and tasks. Getting through some or all of these, especially if you are a bit unfamiliar with the domain, would be a good idea. And help you to hit the ground running in the fall. I will be available during the summer to meet with you as a group once or twice if you wish.

On my <a href='https://kshannon-ucsd.github.io/dsc180ab-sepsis/'>capstone website</a>, all material from last year is available, and I have put a note by the items I think would be good candidates to begin with over the summer:
For clarity, during the summer, the three areas I recommend focusing on would be:
<ul>
<li>Familiarizing yourself with EHR data</li>
<li>Learning about the MIMIC dataset</li>
<li>Beginning to understand a bit more about clinical critical care in an ICU</li>
</ul>

style: "My goal is to create a capstone experience that emulates a practical job setting, guiding students in effectively interacting with managers and data science leads, asking relevant questions, and fulfilling their responsibilities. I may assume various roles (e.g., DS lead, stakeholder, hospital admin, manager) to offer diverse perspectives. I incorporate a business angle to discuss the project's broader context, encouraging students to envision their work in scenarios such as product development or hospital consultancy. This approach helps them grasp real-world applications and develop a compelling narrative for their projects.

I prioritize accessibility for my students throughout the week, for example, via Discord, and may involve domain experts for them to interview and learn from professionals in ICUs and EHR data. This context adds valuable insight and humanizes the data/system. I often hold informal meetings with my students over coffee to discuss progress and answer questions. Occasionally, I expect them to provide progress reports and mini-presentations, simulating a real-world organizational experience.

Letâ€™s have some fun while hacking away at healthcare! But also learn the grave responsibility that comes with working in such a high stakes setting.

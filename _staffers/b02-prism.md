bio: "Brian Duke has been a data scientist for 23 years in the Financial Services industry.  He has worked at Capital One, FICO, SAS Institute, Accenture, Experian, Petal Card and currently is the Head of Data Science at Prism Data.  A common theme in his work has been translating transactional data into useful scores and analytical insights for use in risk decisioning.  Brian received his BA and MS from the University of California, San Diego and continues to reside in the San Diego area today.  He holds 4 patents and has 12 pending in the United States.
<br><br>
Berk Ustun's research lies at the intersection of machine learning, optimization, and human-centered design. His group develops methods for responsible machine learning in medicine, consumer finance, and the physical sciences. They focus on topics like algorithmic fairness, interpretability, and personalization. Previously, he held research positions at Google and at the Harvard Center for Research on Computation and Society. Berk received a PhD in Computer Science from MIT, and Bachelors degrees in Operations Research and Economics from UC Berkeley."
description: "One of the most widely used and little understood parts of the Financial Services industry is the credit score. In this course, students will work with transactional bank data to build statistical models for the purpose of assessing creditworthiness in the financial services industry. The course will take students through the life of a model development project, from data exploration, through model training and evaluation. Students will have the opportunity to work with both structured and unstructured data as they learn about the process and attributes that go into credit scores. Additionally, students will learn about the importance of model explainability and fairness."

prerequisites: DSC140A, DSC140B
time: Friday 10-11AM, Hybrid
style: Our group will consist of group projects completed in groups of 3-4.  The goal of the course is to eventually build a credit score but we will start by building a transaction categorization model using NLP techniques.  Each week we will talk about techniques that can be applied to the next step in the project.  We will begin by reviewing homework from the previous week and discussing ideas.  Then introduce the next step and talk about what can be done to solve the next step in the problem.  The goal is to introduce students to the model development process in most financial services companies.

bio: Ilyes Meftah has been a data scientist and catastrophe modeler with Cotality for 13 years. With a strong background in mathematics and quantitative finance (holding multiple master's degrees from Paris, France universities), Ilyes has developed risk assessment models for wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes throughout his career.                                                                    Recently, he has been focusing his efforts on quantifying wildfire mitigation measures to help communities located in high-risk areas. He is passionate about solving complex problems and sharing knowledge with others. When not working on catastrophe models, he enjoys hiking around the world with his family.

Lawrence Vulis is a senior hazard scientist at Cotality, where he works on building physical and AI-based models of natural hazard risk to properties. Prior projects include (1) machine learning-based classification of river delta geometry, (2) satellite-based tracking of arctic lake spatiotemporal dynamics, (3) linking satellite-derived beach dynamics with off-shore wave climate in Southern California, (4) and a geospatial database/platform for machine learning-based permafrost mapping. His educational background is in Civil and Environmental Engineering, with a B.E. from The City College of New York and a Ph.D. from UC Irvine, with an extended internship and brief stint at Los Alamos National Lab. Outside of work he enjoys spending time with his wife and dog on beaches and trails.

Peter Nagy has been with Cotality for 15 years, applying his passion toward big spatial data problems that occur with parcels, buildings, and geographic data relating to natural hazard risks.  Prior experience includes the virtual earth (streetside) team with Microsoft, as well as multiple projects with Vexcel including SRTM processing, feature extraction from radar imagery, visualizations of raster and vector imagery like polarimetric SAR compositions, and building the RAMS Antarctic DEM.  He studied at the University of Colorado in Boulder where he still lives, enjoying outdoor activities like hiking and skiing.

Domain Title:
Wildfire Risk Intelligence: Advanced Modeling for Climate Resilience

Domain Description:
This domain focuses on developing advanced machine learning techniques to better understand and represent wildfire behavior within fire perimeters. Students will work with Cotality, a leading provider of property information and analytics, to enhance wildfire catastrophe models that directly impact property insurance pricing, emergency management decisions, and community resilience planning. Wildfire catastrophe models rely on simulating the extents and intensities of physically possible wildfires to estimate the probability of wildfire-driven damage to homes. The project aims to design a model that can populate fire intensity within wildfire perimeters, creating more accurate representations of historical events. This work involves working with geospatial data, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques applied to real-world catastrophe modeling challenges. Students will gain experience with industry-standard tools while producing work that has tangible benefits for homeowners, insurers, government agencies, and emergency planners. The skills developed are transferable to climate risk modeling and geospatial analysis across various sectors. Projects will leverage Python/R, GIS, machine learning, and visualization to create solutions with measurable improvements to existing industry methods.



Domain 2

Domain Title:
Wildfire Risk Intelligence: Statistical Modeling of Wildfire Frequency

Domain Description:
This domain focuses on developing cutting-edge data science techniques to better understand, quantify, and mitigate wildfire risks across diverse landscapes. Students will work with Cotality, a leading provider of property information and analytics, to enhance wildfire catastrophe models that directly impact property insurance pricing, emergency management decisions, and community resilience planning. Wildfire catastrophe models rely on simulating the extents and intensities of physically possible wildfires to estimate the probability of wildfire-driven damage to homes. This domain focuses on implementing statistical methods to assign realistic event frequencies to wildfire footprints while matching historical damage patterns. This work involves working with geospatial data, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques applied to real-world catastrophe modeling challenges. Students will gain experience with industry-standard tools while producing work that has tangible benefits for homeowners, insurers, government agencies, and emergency planners. The skills developed are transferable to climate risk modeling and geospatial analysis across various sectors. Projects will leverage Python/R, GIS, machine learning, and statistics to create solutions with measurable improvements to existing industry methods.



Domain 3

Domain Title
Property Intelligence: Enhancing Geospatial Data Quality for Risk Assessment

Domain Description
This domain focuses on solving critical data quality challenges in property analytics that underpin risk assessment models across multiple industries. Students will work with Cotality, a leading provider of property information and analytics, to enhance nationwide property databases through advanced data science techniques. A key part of Cotality's product is providing a standardized type of land use (residential, commercial, agricultural, etc.) for every parcel in the United States. This is used downstream for various purposes including catastrophe risk modelling, tax, and other property level data products. The initial focus of this will be on improving the land use classification across government boundaries, although the domain may entail broader property characteristic enhancement opportunities.
Students will apply machine learning techniques to create standardized property classifications, develop methods to detect and correct data inconsistencies between neighboring counties, and implement quality assurance frameworks for various property attributes. This work directly impacts catastrophe risk modeling, climate risk assessment, mortgage analytics, and urban planning. The project provides hands-on experience with large-scale geospatial datasets, feature engineering, classification algorithms, and data quality methodologies. Students will develop transferable skills in data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering, and model deployment while producing solutions that offer "cross-model impact affecting all catastrophe models and climate-related projects" within the industry. The outcomes will enhance visualization capabilities and improve risk assessment accuracy for multiple stakeholders, including homeowners, financial institutions, and government agencies.

summer: Here are some suggestions:
-	playlist of spatial cluster analysis (week 1 to 8, 14 & 16): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzREt6r1Nenk3L0ndufhYuwdrrfZqdsIA
-	playlist of spatial data science general topics (week 1 to 3): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzREt6r1NenmFyTw8v2JZpEE4PZGNi5Ht
-	Python GIS textbook (read Part II for learning, part III for training before we start) https://pythongis.org/part2/index.html
-	For students who are more comfortable with R, any basic class for spatial manipulation in R (using terra & sf) as well as basic spatial point pattern analysis knowledge
We would be able to recommend more detailed links upon request

time: we have some flexibility but we would generaly prefer thursday morning or friday morning 
ta: mostly Zoom but we should be able to have few sessions in-person
style: Our mentoring approach combines structure with creativity in a collaborative environment. Weekly sessions will balance technical guidance with hands-on problem-solving. Students will have opportunities to interact with multiple catastrophe modeling experts at Cotality, gaining exposure to different perspectives and specialized knowledge. We believe learning works best when it's engaging and enjoyable, so we'll incorporate real-world applications and team-based challenges throughout the project. While we'll provide regular guidance and feedback, we value student initiative and will encourage independent exploration of solutions within our project framework. Our goal is to create an experience that's both intellectually stimulating and professionally valuable.

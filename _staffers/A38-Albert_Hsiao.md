title: Deep learning analysis and augmentation of medical images
bio: |
  Albert Hsiao, MD, PhD is a cardiothoracic radiologist trained in engineering at Caltech and bioengineering and bioinformatics in the UC San Diego Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). He completed his residency and fellowships in Interventional Radiology and Cardiovascular Imaging at Stanford before returning to UC San Diego as faculty in Radiology, where he leads advanced cardiovascular imaging and the Augmented Imaging and Data Analytics (AiDA) research laboratory. While a radiology resident at Stanford, he co-founded Arterys, a cloud-native software company to bring 4D Flow MRI and artificial intelligence technologies to market. He continues to partner with industry to develop and create new imaging technologies to improve diagnosis and management of disease.
description: |
  This group will develop hands-on skill sets for developing deep learning algorithms for medical imaging. In the first quarter, students will reproduce our lab's prior results in chest radiography, including the estimation blood serum markers of heart failure from chest radiographs, using standard CNN architectures. In the second quarter, students will investigate new approaches for interfacing specialized CNN image encoders with strategies that interrogate algorithm explainability.
summer: |
  May be worthwhile reviewing this paper which will be a substantial component of the first quarter https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9768796
time: Mondays at 11am
modality: In-person
ta: TBA
style: Students will meet weekly with me and additionally interface with scientists, post-doctoral fellows and graduate students in the lab.

title: Communication Complexity
bio: I work broadly in theoretical computer science, with a specific interest in computational complexity, randomness and pseudo-randomness, algebraic constructions, optimization, and combinatorics.
description: |
  Communication complexity is a field of theoretical computer science that studies the amount of communication required between two or more parties to jointly compute a function whose input is distributed among them. In its most basic model, two players—Alice and Bob—receive inputs x and y respectively, and want to jointly compute some function f(x,y) using as little communication as possible. The focus is on minimizing the number of bits exchanged, under various models (deterministic, randomized, or quantum), while still correctly computing the function.

  This model has been studied extensively since its introduction in the 80s, with many notable applications, but still there are many fundamental problems that are wide open. These include the log-rank conjecture, which attempts to classify the structure of efficient deterministic protocols using linear algebra; understanding the combinatorial structure of functions with efficient randomized protocols; analogs of these to multi-party settings; and many others. 

  Moreover, problems in communication complexity tend to have strong connections to fundamental problems in combinatorics and other areas of math, which sometimes gives a unique perspective to help understand these problems better.

  The book "Communication Complexity and Applications" by Rao and Yehudayoff is a good starting point. See also the following surveys for more recent progress related to my work:

time: Mondays 1-2pm
ta: In-person (will book own room)
style: Initially the capstone project will run standalone, as students learn the area. Then, depending on their interest, we can potentially join an existing research project or they work on their own research project.

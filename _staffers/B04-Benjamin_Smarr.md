title: Developing lessons to ease teachers into time series data science
bio: Prof. Smarr comes from a neuroscience and biological rhythms background. His lab focuses on using longitudinal data sources to develop novel analytics that reveal biologically relevant information from these data, framed by an understanding of the way biological data tend to change at different timescales. This is sometimes naturalistic, but more often related to biomedical algorithm development.
description: Data science skills can be transformative, especially when deployed in communities without historical access to digital resources. UCSD supports tools that make access to data science free, but without lessons aimed at helping teachers make confident use of these tools, most teachers won't get the potential of data science training, and won't want to offer curricula to their students. Our goal will be to develop light weight lessons that take someone from zero knowledge to the ability to load small data sets into JupyterLite webpages and carry out basic analyses and visualization, so that they can feel good showing others in their community how these skills could help their students.
summer: Read https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5301430/ and https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35870975/, and develop some familiarity recreating the figures and analyses.
time: After 1, before 5
ta: In-person (will book own room)
style: You will work mostly within your group, with some guidance from graduate students who have done related work. You will also meet weekly with Prof. Smarr to assess progress and shape next steps.
seats: 8

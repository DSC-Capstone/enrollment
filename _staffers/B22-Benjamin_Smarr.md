title: Classification of lab mouse behavior in various disease models
bio: |
  Prof. Smarr comes from a neuroscience and biological rhythms background. His lab focuses on using longitudinal data sources to develop novel analytics that reveal biologically relevant information from these data, framed by an understanding of the way biological data tend to change at different timescales. This is sometimes naturalistic, but more often related to biomedical algorithm development.
  Manny Ruidiaz is a Distinguished Technology Leader with demonstrated experience in agricultural, biotechnology, machine learning and applied imaging sectors. Heâ€™s delivered multiple successful, high-impact, end-to-end projects, and has enabled new business opportunities.

  Jackson Labs (Jax) breeds many of the mice used in biomedical research. These mice often have specific generic differences that model aspects of disease. Phenotyping these animals involves connecting changes in their genes to changes in their actual lives. This is still mostly done by hand, where someone looks and notes how excitable or stressed or attentive an animal is. But humans are error prone and slow, so there's been a rise in efforts to video capture animals in their home cages, and then use AI to identify differences in behavior. While a number of tools to support this exist now, parametrization of video data is often suboptimal or not biologically grounded, and results are often hard to visualize. TLR Ventures is a start up developing AIs to phenotype Jax mice from videos. As a new industrial partner with HDSI they are excited to see what clever solutions and tools students will come up with to improve phenotyping and or visualization tools to assist biologists who want to make use of these data. 
  Through this experience you will learn about video processing and featurization, biomedical research and biological rhythms, signal processing, and you can help decide on additional areas of focus, as in visualization, application of transformers, or anything else you might want to explore. You will also gain experience interacting with industry partners, and if you find the work compelling, possibly also a job opportunity.

  Learn a little about TLR Ventures (https://theorg.com/org/tlr-ventures) and about Jax mice https://www.jax.org/). Please also look into automated behavior analysis. The following is a good paper giving an example of how good video analysis can uncover important classifications that were not obvious by eye or by statistical aggregation.
time: TBA
modality: In-person (will book own room)
ta: TBA
style: I like to support exploration. I will provide overviews of techniques and relevant biology, and I will help you identify goals each week. You will do that with me, so that we use this opportunity to challenge you, but also to provide an excuse for you to learn things you wanted to learn, but maybe needed data and or guidance to actually dive in.

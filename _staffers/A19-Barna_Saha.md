  Reading theoretical papers related to fine-grained complexity and learning how to prove theorems. Fine-grained complexity seeks to explore the complexity of algorithms beyond the traditional coarse distinction between polynomial-time and NP-hard problems. The central idea is to investigate the relationships between different computational problems and identify those that are "hard" in a more fine-grained sense.

title: Comparing Maps from Human Brain Imaging
bio: With an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, I discovered statistics for my PhD and have been doing data science since then (even when it wasn't called by that name). Much of my work involves signal and image analysis, but I'm interested in many theoretical and applied problems, even philosophical. Outside of academia, I like doing music, dancing, swimming, surfing, and more.
description: The organization of the human brain is incredibly complex. Over the past decades in neuroscience, researchers have measured the human brain with increasing spatial and temporal resolutionâ€“using imaging, recording, tracing, and sequencing technologies. This has yielded detailed maps of the spatial structure (e.g. cortical thickness, receptor densities, gene expression) and functional properties (e.g., task activations, functional connectivity) of the brain. Comparing these brain maps is fundamental to understanding the complexities of brain organization, but presents unique challenges. Measures of spatial associations between brain maps are strongly influenced by spatial autocorrelation, leading to inflated false positives if not properly accounted for. This project explores methods in spatial statistics for testing the association between brain maps, enabling researchers to more accurately interpret map-to-map similarities and differences. We will learn how to: (1) work with neuroimaging data in Python, (2) understand and implement existing methods for comparing maps while accounting for spatial autocorrelation, (3) and apply these methods to open-access datasets.
summer: Reading material:
- Comparing spatial null models for brain maps, Markello and Misic 2021 
(paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33857618/, code: https://markello-spatialnulls.netlify.app/#)
- Neuromaps: structural and functional interpretation of brain maps, Markello et. al. 2022
(paper: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36203018/, code: https://netneurolab.github.io/neuromaps/)
time: Wednesday 3:30-4:30PM (with some flexibility aoround this)
ta: In-person (need room booked for me; required if mentoring >4 students in-person)
style: Mentoring will involve data science PhD student Gabriel Riegner. Students are expected to take ownership over the project. This implies taking initiative in learning about the topic (from the assigned material and other sources), implementing the methods in code, being resourceful when needing help, and asking questions. Students are expected to put in their best effort, plan their time over the quarter, make substantial progress each week, report on it each week, and come up with an action plan for the next steps (as opposed to waiting for the mentor to give instructions). In other words, be independent and ask for help when needed.

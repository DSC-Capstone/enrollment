description: |
  Knowledge graphs are powerful tools for representing complex biological systems by modeling entitiesâ€”such as genes, proteins, diseases, and drugsâ€”and the relationships between them. At the same time, agentic systems are capable of autonomous reasoning and goal-directed action. Combining these approaches enables the development of systems that can navigate vast biomedical knowledge networks, supporting researchers in hypothesis generation and data exploration.

  This group is for students interested in this intersection, drawing on principles from artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and the life sciences to create intelligent agents that can explore biomedical data and deliver meaningful insights.

title: Mining Privacy Designs in the News
bio: Human developers create risky computer systems that eventually affect human users. Our lab, Data Smith Lab, takes a human-centered approach to (1) help developers create systems with enhanced privacy and security features and (2) help users safeguard their privacy and security.
description: Mining Privacy Designs in the News aims to uncover the patterns, strategies, and tensions in how digital privacy is represented across news media. By analyzing a large corpus of news articles, this work surfaces recurring narratives, metaphors, and framings that shape public understanding of privacy. Through this lens, we can trace how societal norms, stakeholder agendas, and cultural anxieties are reflected in—and influenced by—media discourse, offering a foundation for more responsive design, policy, and public engagement.

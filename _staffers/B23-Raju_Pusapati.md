description: |
  A comprehensive disease knowledge base integrates ICD-10, WHO classifications, MeSH terms, and rare disease registries to enable standardizing disease definitions including subtypes, phenotypic variations and evolving classifications; and reduces ambiguity in electronic health records (EHRs), genomic studies, and real-world evidence (RWE) analysis.

  However, challenges persist due to:
  - Heterogeneous disease nomenclatures (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes" vs. "T2DM" vs. "NIDDM")
  - Inconsistent hierarchical mappings (e.g., autoimmune disorders, cancer subtypes)
  - Sparse or conflicting annotations for rare diseases
  - Manual curation bottlenecks in updating ontologies (e.g., ICD-11 transitions)

  AI-assisted data curation addresses these gaps by automating:
  - **Semantic Labeling & Tagging**: AI-assisted labeling and tagging of disease names, synonyms, and subtypes from unstructured text (EHRs, literature) helps organize data and automate repetitive Human-in-the-Loop feedback. Additionally, AI-driven data sampling for model training will overcome class imbalance and scarcity of labeled data.
  - **Hierarchical Classification**: Machine learning models will map diseases to standard ontologies (ICD, SNOMED, MONDO) and infer subtype relationships.
  - **Conflict Resolution**: Disambiguation of overlapping terms (e.g., "ALS" as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis vs. Advanced Life Support).

  **Expected Project Deliverables**:
  1. Ontology Mapping with detailed data dictionary and schema documentation  
  2. Rules and Analysis conducted for data cleanup for conflicts/outliers  
  3. Demo of the work including models and data stores used (SQL, NoSQL, Vector DB), architecture stack, and training methodology  
  4. Documentation including pseudo/source code and model performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for semantic labeling and hierarchical classification

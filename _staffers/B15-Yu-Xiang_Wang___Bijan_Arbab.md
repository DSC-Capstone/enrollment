title: Differentially private synthetic telemetry data with modern generative AI
bio: I am a faculty member of the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego, also affliated with the CSE department. Broadly speaking, my students and I apply math and computing to (1) design faster, stronger and more efficient ML algorithms with provable guarantees (2) solve societal challenges (e.g., data privacy, abuse prevention) that emerge in the AI era. Our recent focus include watermarking generative AI, making differential privacy practical, bridging offline and online RL, developing a theory of adaptivity in deep learning. 
description: Differentially private synthetic data generation plays a crucial role in enabling data sharing and analysis while preserving individual privacy. By creating artificial datasets that statistically resemble real data without revealing any specific individual's information, this approach allows organizations to comply with privacy regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA. It fosters innovation and collaboration by making sensitive data accessible to researchers, developers, and analysts without exposing personal details. Furthermore, the use of differential privacy techniques ensures that the risk of re-identifying individuals remains mathematically bounded, providing strong, quantifiable privacy guarantees. This balance between utility and privacy is essential for advancing fields like healthcare, finance, and social science in a responsible and ethical manner.   In this specific project, you will work with me and  HDSI Industry Fellow Dr. Bijan Arbab to

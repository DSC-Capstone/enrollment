description: |
  The development of compound AI systems, integrating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with agentic frameworks, external tools, and knowledge bases, has recently gained considerable popularity. Agentic frameworks are pivotal, harnessing recent advancements in LLMs to enable synergistic interaction with external tools, thereby facilitating the creation of these sophisticated systems. Knowledge graphs play a crucial role, particularly in the life sciences, by structuring complex information related to biological knowledge, pharmaceuticals, adverse effects, mechanisms of action, and other pertinent entities.
  In this course we will delve into the application of integrated agentic frameworks and knowledge graphs for developing innovative solutions in life science domains. Example applications to be explored include hypothesis generation for scientific discovery, prediction of treatment outcomes, identification of adverse effects, optimization of clinical trials, and formulation of personalized health and lifestyle recommendations.
  This offering is designed for students interested in this interdisciplinary areas, drawing upon principles from artificial intelligence, knowledge representation, and the life sciences. The objective is to empower students to design intelligent agents capable of interrogating biomedical data to yield actionable insights.
  Suggested pre-requisites - Python,  knowledge),  GenAI architecture patterns (RAG), agentic frameworks exposure (preferred), knowledge of life sciences/ biology (will be useful but not mandatory)

title: Understanding deep learning through feature learning
bio: |
  Tianhao Wang will be joining the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego as a tenure-track assistant professor in July 2025.
  He received his PhD from the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Yale University in 2024.
  Prior to Yale, he received his BS from University of Science and Technology of China in 2018.
  His research interests are mainly in theoretical foundations of statistical learning, especially high-dimensional statistics and deep learning.

  The success of deep learning is often attributed to the ability of neural networks to learn useful features from data. Yet, the process of feature learning remains mysterious. In this project, we aim to develop fundamental understanding of how neural networks learn features, with an emphasis on the dynamical perspective of the training process. We will explore feature learning for various neural network architectures, and investigate surprising phenomena in deep learning such as implicit regularization and grokking, etc. Participants will gain hands-on experience in training neural networks and analyzing the training process.
summer: It would be helpful to get familiar with deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or Jax.
time: Friday
ta: In-person (need room booked for me; required if mentoring >4 students in-person)
style: Participants should feel free to explore on their own if they find a specific topic interesting. Meanwhile, participants will have opportunities to work with my PhD students. I will provide hands-on guidance.
seats: 8
tag: theory

title: ALERTCalifornia - Extreme Events Detection
bio: |
  Nathan Hui is currently a research engineer at UC San Diego at the Qualcomm Institute. His area of focus is multi-domain robotics, 3D imaging, and distributed sensor networks. Previous projects include tracking transmittered wildlife using drones, measuring physical oceanographic data using intelligent surfboard fins, and measuring fish length using low-cost lasers, dive cameras, and machine learning.

  Prof. Kuester received an MS degree in Mechanical Engineering in 1994 and MS degree in Computer Science and Engineering in 1995 from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. In 2001 he received a Ph.D. from the University of California, Davis and currently is the Calit2 Professor for Visualization and Virtual Reality at the University of California, San Diego. Professor Kuester holds appointments as Professor in the Departments of Structural Engineering and Computer Science and Engineering at the Jacobs School of Engineering (JSoE) and serves as the director of the Cultural Heritage Engineering Initiative (CHEI), the Center of Interdisciplinary Science for Art, Architecture and Archaeology (CISA3), the Calit2 Center of Graphics, Visualization and Virtual Reality (GRAVITY) and the DroneLab.

  Neal Driscoll is a professor of geology and geophysics in the Geosciences Research Division at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego. Driscoll researches tectonic deformation and the evolution of landscapes and seascapes. His work primarily focuses on the sediment record to understand the processes that shaped the earth. As part of this research, Driscoll spends time at sea acquiring images of the seafloor and subsurface layers to understand the processes that shape Earth. Driscoll is also co-director of UC San Diego’s Center for Public Preparedness (CP2) and the ALERTCalifornia public safety program. ALERTCalifornia provides critical infrastructure for mitigating wildfire and natural disaster risk to life, property and ecosystems. The advanced network of more than 1000 cameras across California helps first responders monitor natural disasters such as wildfires, floods, and landslides. ALERTCalifornia is a vital resource that provides an array of technological tools, infrastructure and research that supports government agencies, utilities and the public in their response to ever-increasing natural disaster risk. ALERTCalifornia also gathers vital data to inform the greater understanding of natural disaster causes, active event behavior and post-event impacts to air quality, water quality, ecosystems, and human health.
description: |
  The ALERTCalifornia research program continues UC San Diego’s more than 20-year legacy of collecting high-quality data through a network of natural hazard monitoring and detection cameras across the state. This growing network includes over 1,150 camera sensors that provide real-time imagery. They are located in wild spaces, on towers, and other high points across the entire state of California, and are used to watch for and monitor extreme events including wildfire and weather. The program’s historical archive of camera data contains over 38 billion timestamped and localized frames. These camera data have facilitated CALFIRE’s ability to rapidly respond to emerging wildfires as well as maintain situational awareness during ongoing wildfires and other natural disasters.

  We would like to investigate where machine learning techniques can assist with assessing camera network health, data integrity, and environmental signals. Potential projects include camera site uptime detection, cloud detection, marine layer height detection, Visual Flight Rules altitude estimation, horizon detection, or camera positioning calibration.
summer: |
  Students should be able to utilize Nautilus NRP, be familiar with active learning techniques, semi-supervised or unsupervised learning, and utilizing web APIs. We expect most work to be done in Python. Please also be familiar with Docker, Poetry, Kubernetes, and Tornado.
time: Mo/Tu/We/Th 10am-3pm
modality: In-person (will book own room)
ta: TBD

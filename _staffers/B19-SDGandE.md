title: From Data to Dispatch - Optimizing SDG&E Field Services
bio: |
  Dr. Nguyen graduated from UCSD with a Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering, where he developed nanomaterials for clean energy applications. He then worked for several years as a consultant in the energy sector, where his focus was on using data to support policies that promote clean energy and energy efficiency. Dr. Nguyen joined SDG&E to focus on developing models to mitigate wildfire risk in California and has since expanded his work to other areas that benefit San Diego communities.

  Charles ("Chuck") Hahm is a Data Scientist in SDGE's Customer Field Service organization. His data science experience spans a range of industries, including cybersecurity, customer analytics, sensor analytics, medical diagnostics, and image processing. He has served as adjunct faculty and course developer in National University's graduate analytics program. In the government sector, he has served as Principal Investigator for SBIR (Small Business Innovative Research) grants for the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, and National Institutes of Health. Chuck holds a master's degree in electrical engineering from the Illinois Institute of Technology and a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois at Chicago.

  Dr. Fatemeh Aarabi holds a PhD in operations research from State University of New York at Buffalo. During her doctoral studies, she focused on applied operations research methods like routing and scheduling algorithms with applications in urban systems. After graduation she joined industry to develop optimization frameworks for emergency management systems, working on optimization algorithms and ML predictive methods to reduce the EMS response time. In 2022 Fatemeh joined SDGE as a data scientist where she has focused on developing models to mitigate wildfire risk in California.

  This capstone offers students a unique opportunity to partner with San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) to improve how field services—like metering, inspections, and emergency repairs—are delivered across the region. Students will work directly with field technicians and analysts to explore how data science can optimize truck dispatches, reduce operational costs, and enhance safety, all while improving the customer experience for San Diegans.

  Using real-world utility data, students may apply machine learning, geospatial analysis, and optimization techniques to solve challenges such as predicting equipment failures, streamlining technician routes, or identifying service anomalies. This project is ideal for students eager to connect data with real-world impact, gain experience in applied analytics, and contribute to a more efficient and customer-focused energy future.
summer: None
time: TBD
modality: Hybrid – weekly virtual meetings + occasional meetings on SDG&E campus
ta: TBA

  The student group will be a stand-alone unit at SDG&E led by Mentors. Mentors will first work with students to understand utility space, and then schedule time with other SDG&E staff who will provide tours, field visits, and other utility-specific training. Students will also be introduced to other data scientists and engineers at SDG&E who are available for support on an as-needed basis throughout the duration of the project. However, once an introduction is made, it will be up to the students to reach out to staff when support is needed. Students will be encouraged to present their ideas to staff members beyond the mentors.

description: "In partnership with SDG&E's Clean Transportation Team, students will embark on a pivotal journey to propel electric vehicle (EV) adoption forward by investigating the intricate connections between EVs, urban infrastructure, and energy dynamics. This venture is pivotal for fostering a sustainable tomorrow. By diving into real-world data from diverse sources such as historical EV adoption statistics, community engagement on EV platforms, and the extensive road networks from OpenStreetMap, participants will utilize a suite of analytical tools including time-series analysis, graph theory, and text analytics to unearth insights. The endeavor will harness these analyses to pinpoint strategic locations for EV charging stations, aiming to build a robust and accessible infrastructure. Additionally, projects will leverage predictive modeling techniques to forecast and prepare for the evolving demands of a future where electric mobility is the norm. Through this hands-on experience, students will not only contribute to San Diego's transition to clean transportation but also develop valuable skills that echo the needs of an eco-conscious society."
summer:
oldstudent: https://jcheung4.github.io/DSC180B-Website/
prerequisites: None
time: TBD (Schedule with mentor), Hybrid
style: "The student group will be a stand-alone unit at SDG&E led by Mentors. Mentors will first work with students to understand utility space, and then schedule time with other SDG&E staff who will provide tours, field visits, and other utility-specific training. Students will also be introduced to other data scientists and engineers at SDG&E who are available for support on an as-needed basis throughout the duration of the project. However, once an introduction is made, it will be up to the students to reach out to staff when support is needed. Students will be encouraged to present their ideas by staff members beyond the mentors."

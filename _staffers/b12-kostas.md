title: Graph ML for Chip Profiling
bio: "Lindsey is a Senior Staff Machine Learning Engineer. She joined a nascent ML R&D team at Qualcomm in 2018 and since that time she has led multiple projects in ML-based CAD/EDA which have impacted global SoC design process for teams across the globe leading to significant savings in time-to-market, compute and NRE cost. She holds two granted and five pending patents related to this work and consults on a variety of ML-driven initiatives across the company in application ranging from digital and analog design to 5G to licensing. In 2021, she was honored by the Global Semiconductor Association (GSA) as the inaugural Female Up-And-Comer for her exceptional contributions toward the development, innovation, growth, and success in the semiconductor industry.<br><br>
Prior to joining Qualcomm, Lindsey was a 4-year scholarship athlete at Stanford University where she won two tennis national team championships and was honored as an Elite 89 Award Finalist. After graduating with distinction in Economics, she obtained her master’s degree in Computer Science with an emphasis in Artificial Intelligence from Stanford University. While in the master’s program Lindsey was a teaching assistant and a research associate for Chris Re and Jure Leskovic with an emphasis in deep representation learning. Her current research interests are building interpretable and explainable optimization solutions which combine traditional ML, generative AI, and classical algorithms and how to translate ML solutions into usable end-to-end tools."
description: "Machine Learning is becoming an increasingly necessary technique in the design of chips due to the end of Moore’s Law and the increased complexity of the process, functionality requirements, and design time limits. A circuit represents a complex graph with unique properties that do not exist in more common graph ML applications such as those for social networks or biologic entities. As a result, graph machine learning offers a powerful set of techniques to understand the fundamental properties of the chip design and thereby create better designs more quickly. This capstone will expose students to graph algorithms and graph ML through the exploration of unsupervised learning on chip designs and equip them with the skills to tackle arbitrary graph modeling tasks.<br>
Learning Objectives:<br>
-	Develop deep understanding of graph analysis techniques, both classical graph algorithms and machine learning approaches.<br>
-	Gain exposure to a variety of Graph ML architectures and their properties.<br>
-	Develop an intuition for selection of graph modeling architectures based on the characteristics of the underlying graph of interest.<br>
-	Explore custom architectures to handle complex graph structures.<br>
-	In the absence of ideal labels, learn how to develop and unsupervised ML solution or define proxy tasks for training a model with the desired properties.<br>
-	Learn the basics about chip design and ML for chip design.<br>

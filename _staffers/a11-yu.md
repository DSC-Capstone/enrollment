title: Probabilistic Deep Sequence Models for Bayesian Optimization
bio: "Rose Yu is an assistant professor at UC San Diego department of Computer Science and Engineering. She is a primary faculty with the AI Group and is affiliated with Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute.

Her research interests lie primarily in machine learning, especially for large-scale spatiotemporal data. She is particularly excited about AI for scientific discovery. She has won ECASE Award, NSF CAREER Award, Hellman Fellowship, Faculty Awards from JP Morgan, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Adobe, several Best Paper Awards, and Best Dissertation Award at USC.<br><br>

Yian Ma is an assistant professor at the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and an affliated faculty member at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of University of California San Diego. Prior to UCSD, he spent a year as a visiting faculty at Google Research.
 
His current research primarily revolves around scalable inference methods for credible machine learning. This involves designing Bayesian inference methods to quantify uncertainty in the predictions of complex models; understanding computational and statistical guarantees of inference algorithms; and leveraging these scalable algorithms to learn from time series data and perform sequential decision making tasks."
description: "Decision-making under uncertainty requires models that can generate not only point estimates but also confidence intervals. We investigate deep sequence models for Bayesian optimization in spatiotemporal domain, with the goal to reduce sample complexity, provide risk assessment, and guide policy making."

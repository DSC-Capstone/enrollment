title: Causal Copilot
bio: |
  I am an assistant professor at HDSI. My research focus is causal discovery and causal AI.
description: |
  This domain focuses on causal discovery—the process of learning cause-and-effect relationships from data—and the development of a Causal Copilot, an AI assistant that helps users automatically learn and interpret causal relationships. Students will explore methods to learn causal graphs from observational data, simulate interventions, and answer “what-if” questions across domains like health, economics, and science. The project combines causal inference, machine learning, and interactive AI systems.

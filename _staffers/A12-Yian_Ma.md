title: Quantifying the credibility of large language model outputs
bio: I am an assistant professor at the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and an affliated faculty member at the Computer Science and Engineering Department of University of California San Diego. Prior to UCSD, I spent a year as a visiting faculty at Google Research. Before that, I was a post-doctoral fellow at EECS, UC Berkeley. I completed my Ph.D. at University of Washington and obtained my bachelor's degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.

  Accurate uncertainty quantification in large language models (LLMs) is essential for providing credible confidence estimates over their outputs. We will explore how to quantify the uncertainty and credibility of the LLM outputs. Specifically, we will explore prompt perturbation methods over open source LLM models.

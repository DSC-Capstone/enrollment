title: Hunting for Ghost Particles -  Analyzing Time Series Data produced by Semiconductor Detectors
bio: |
  I am Aobo Li (you can call me obo, like the musical instrument). I am a new faculty at HDSI & the Department of Physics. I earned my B.S. from UW Seattle and my PhD from Boston University, both in the field of physics. My research uses machine learning to squeeze out the maximum amount of information from ultra-sensitive radiation detectors, all in the quest to uncover extremely rare physics events in our universe.

  Neutrinos are tiny particles that are almost like ghosts because they can pass through just about anything without being noticed. They're produced in huge numbers by the sun and other stars, but catching them is really tough because they hardly ever interact with other matters. Scientists use special, super sensitive equipment such as Semiconductor Detector to try and spot these sneaky particles and learn more about how the universe works.

  The Majorana Demonstrator experiment utilizes an array of these Semiconductor Detectors to capture neutrinos hidden in the time series data generated by these detectors. In this project, we will establish an analysis team dedicated to examining this time series data. The team will undertake multiple analytical tasks, including employing machine learning models for time series classification and regression, aiming to produce an energy spectrum akin to the one generated by the Majorana Demonstrator.

  The Majorana Demonstrator data we will analyze is already available online.

  Data Release Notes:  
  https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.1085

  All students who wish to get involved in this project should make sure to read the Data Release Notes carefully. Students should also try to download the data and make sure they can extract information from it (the data is stored in .hdf5 file format).

  Machine Learning Prerequisite -  
  Students should make sure they can design, run and validate machine learning models for classification and regression tasks, ideally using PyTorch to build and train simple neural networks. During the data analysis process, students will have the freedom to pick their own models to use.

  Analysis Coordinator -   
  One of the enrolled students will be elected as the analysis coordinator (AC) of this project. AC will take a leadership role to coordinate model development among different subgroups and manage this project at a higher level. This will be an excellent leadership experience that can be highlighted on a student's CV. If you are interested in this position, please send an email to aol002@ucsd.edu. If no one volunteers, the advisor will appoint one student as the AC. Please be prepared to serve as the AC if you enroll in this project.

  To achieve our final analysis goal—the detector spectrum—students will need to construct and train 3–5 machine learning models using a fully labeled dataset. One of these models will address a regression task, while the others will tackle binary classification, using 0/1 labels.

  An Analysis Coordinator (AC) will oversee the entire model-building process and document everything in a unified analysis document. Within the project, we will form subgroups; each will select a machine learning task, propose a model to accomplish it, and provide weekly updates during meetings to track progress.

  The AC and I will engage with each student weekly to discuss their tasks and provide feedback on their updates. Additionally, students will receive detailed assistance from the AC on coding and technical aspects, whereas I will focus on providing in-depth guidance to the AC.

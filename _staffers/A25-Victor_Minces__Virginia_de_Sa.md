title: Scrolling sound and talking hand
bio: |
  Victor Minces studied fine arts and physics at the University of Buenos Aires, and obtained his Ph.D. in computational neuroscience at UCSD. He researched how the brain represents sensory stimuli, including light and rhythmic sound, and the cognitive basis of musical rhythm. He created a program making widely used web applications and hands-on activities for people to play, experiment, and learn about sound. Besides his science and technology endeavors, he is a sound artist and performer, leading audiences of hundreds of people to explore and create sound together. Recently, his team has been designing original sonic interfaces for people to create sound and music, listen to audiobooks, and communicate.

  HDSI's Associate Director de Sa is a leader in the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, computer science, engineering, and data science. Her research utilizes multiple approaches to increase our understanding of how humans and machines learn to perceive the world around them. She earned her Ph.D. and master’s in Computer Science from the University of Rochester, and a bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Engineering from Canada’s Queen’s University.

  My team has been developing an audio listening interface that can transform the way people consume podcasts, audiobooks, and videos. People are increasingly acquiring, creating, and sharing knowledge through audio and video, rather than reading. A problem with audio information, as opposed to reading, is that it is very difficult to 'scroll'. For example, if you space out while listening to a podcast, it can be cumbersome to find the last moment you were paying attention. It can also be difficult to skim through audio, dynamically changing the playback speed, forwards and back, to find the information you need. We are looking to solve this problem by creating a more organic listening interface. The task is creative, the possibilities endless, and there is a lot to learn.

  Another direction of my team is a 'talking hand', which transforms hand movements into speech. It can also sing! https://talkinghandminces.netlify.app/

  - Research algorithms to slow down and speed up sound, such as vocoders and granular synthesis. Reproduce one if possible.
  - Learn about frequency decomposition, spend some time playing with https://spectrogram.sciencemusic.org/
  - If you are interested in the talking hand, watch and carefully study this video: https://youtu.be/aFnWSBKImQU?si=hwO5GX55HA3oV6KD
  - And this video: https://youtu.be/fxYCk1t5DKE?si=Lrn7c_JzvD9ueTB2
  - And if you can, watch the whole series.
  - Reach out to me and I can assign you some tasks depending on your current knowledge and interest.
time: Any day after 10am, preferably Tuesday to Thursday
ta: In-person (need room booked for me; required if mentoring >4 students in-person)
style: |
  My students typically work independently, but I am very supportive. I meet with them once a week, but I am open (and happy) to follow up more often. I have experienced undergrads working with me, who can help guide new students. Dr. De Sa, and perhaps her students, will also be involved in mentoring, specifically as it refers to machine learning.

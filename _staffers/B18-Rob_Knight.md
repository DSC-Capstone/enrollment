title: Deep learning for understanding microbiome results
bio: |
  While researching the origins of life as a postdoc in Boulder, Colorado, I developed algorithms for comparing RNA that turned out to be enabling technologies for the whole microbiome field. I moved to UCSD at the end of 2014 to lead the Center for Microbiome Innovation, and my lab focuses on developing new technologies to read out and understand complex microbial communities in the environment and the human body. I gave a TED talk that has been viewed > 2 million times and wrote two popular books on the microbiome. Outside academia, I like to travel, cook, hike, and paddleboard.

  This group is for students interested in exploring applications of deep learning to the microbiome space. The first few weeks of the course will be devoted to understanding what the microbiome is and past approaches to analyzing it, together with opportunities to apply deep learning techniques in various ways to analysis of the microbial DNA sequences, communities, and/or annotations. The specific results that will be re-analyzed and techniques used will be driven by student interests. For example, past capstone classes have focused on the microbiome as a source of health disparities in Hispanic and Latino populations, use of protein language models to identify antimicrobial peptides, and use of DNA language models to identify mutations associated with drug resistance or to analyze relationships between entire microbial communities and phenotype. Currently emerging opportunities include development of digital twin models of humans, spatial sequencing, and long-read metagenomics.

   Familiarity with Python, Pandas and PyTorch are essential. Depending on project,  TensorFlow, scikit-bio and STAN could be useful."
time: TBA

  Capstone group will run as separate, focused entity, with relevant members of lab (grad students, postdocs) providing additional perspective/co-mentorship. Attendance of lab meetings/code reviews for the whole lab is optional.

  Graph data is ubiquitous in a broad range of applications. There are two major families of graph learning models: graph neural networks, and transformer-based graph learning models. However, while graph neural networks, such as message-passing graph neural networks, can naturally handle graph-type data (both nodes, edges, and features along nodes and edges), standard transformer architectures are designed for sequences or sets, not for the relational type of data like graphs. There thus has to be a way to encode the graph structures into transformers. There are various design choices. In this capstone project, we would like to explore the pros and cons of different design choices of encoding graph information over a collection of graph tasks.

time: Wed morning 9am preferred
ta: In-person (need room booked for me; required if mentoring >4 students in-person)
style: |
  In the first few weeks we will give some "lectures" on the background, together with reading / experimenting materials. Usually students form groups of around 3 students each to develop the capstone projects.
seats: 16

title: Learning and Using Causal Knowledge for Advancing AI and Scientific Discovery
bio: "Biwei Huang is an Assistant Professor at HDSI. Previously, I received my Ph.D degree from CMU. My research interests include causal discovery and inference, causality-related machine learning, and computational science.<br>

Jelena Bradic is a Full Professor at the UC San Diego, where she holds a joint appointment in the Department of Mathematical Sciences and Halicioglu Data Science Institute. Prof. Bradic's interests are in causal inference, machine  learning, robust statistics as well as missing data problems. Her application areas  include  observational and interventional data,  treatment effects,  as well as public health and policy learning. She strives to understand and develop new robust learning methods and algorithms with provable guarantees of stability, robustness to data corruption and data generating mechanism."
description: "Causal information is essential in many tasks in empirical sciences and engineering. For example, in medical science, to find out an effective, reliable treatment for Alzheimerâ€™s disease, it is crucial to find the underlying genetic factors that are responsible for the disease and figure out how they jointly influence the disease. In AI, to achieve general-purpose AI with the capacity of reasoning, acting, and generalizing to novel domains or tasks, one challenge is to move beyond domain-specific pattern recognition towards the discovery and use of underlying causal relationships that produce stable and interpretable patterns across general scenarios of interest. To this end, two questions naturally arise: how can one acquire causal knowledge and, furthermore, how should we use it? Accordingly, we will focus on these two questions and study tools on (1) automated causal discovery and inference from non-experimental data in complex environments, (2) advancing machine learning from the causal perspective, and (3) using or adapting causal discovery and inference approaches to solve scientific problems.

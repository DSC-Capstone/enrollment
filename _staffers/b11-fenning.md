title: Learning How to Make a Better Solar Cell using Molecular Graphs 
bio: "I'm a materials scientist who is working on developing platforms for accelerated discovery of new solar energy conversion materials."
description: "Perovskite solar cells are an emerging technology that holds promise to revolutionize the PV industry given their unprecedented performance. Small molecules are added to these solar cells to terminate chemical bonds at the interfaces of the perovskite to enable improved stability. Today, the discovery of such molecules is done largely by Edisonian experimentation. A significant challenge is the broad chemical space, and the complexity of of the interface limits the application of theory. We seek to use literature mining and complimentary automated experiments in our lab run by python scripts to learn what makes molecules successful using graph-based representations of the molecules and to optimize the graphs to discover new molecules and gain deeper insight into the problem."

title: Community-Centered Discrimination Audits of LLMs - Bias Rapid Action Teams
bio: |
  Iâ€™m a social scientist with a background in the humanities, especially history and philosophy of science and technology, but I have enough expertise in computer science and data science to make trouble. I believe that data science systems should be fair, transparent, and accountable to the public, but that most are currently not. A lot of my research is in community-centered content moderation NLP systems for user-generated content, especially Wikipedia, where I formerly worked on their ML models and systems.
description: |
  This capstone will work with community members to audit pretrained Large Language Models for discrimination and bias, using perturbation-based or controlled-experimental methods. These systematically vary a template prompt along a potential type of discrimination, then observe differences in outputs. For example, if you ask ChatGPT (or TritonGPT) to act as a college admissions reviewer, does an application's score change if it references the Mens vs Womens basketball team? Or being on the lacrosse versus basketball team? Or being from La Jolla versus San Ysidro?

  These methods are relatively simple from a statistics perspective, but the hard part is knowing what kinds of discrimination are of most concern to the people who will be impacted by model outputs and creating real-world template prompts that test for those concerns. This capstone will be centered around **talking and listening to real people** about their concerns with LLMs in real-world contexts, then using our data science expertise in a more consulting-style mode. If a team chooses university admissions, they might work with students, high school counselors, professors, and/or admissions staff. All students must take and pass the 3-hour UCSD/CITI IRB Human Subject Protection Training online course (Social and Behavioral Basic) by week 3 of Fall.

  Take UCSD/CITI IRB Human Subject Protection Training online course (Social and Behavioral Basic), must complete by week 3 of Fall, but good to do it earlier. Register at citiprogram.org and see this video for how to register:

time: Wednesdays 10-11am
ta: TBA
modality: In-person (need room booked for me; required if mentoring >4 students in-person)
style: |
  I will be the point of contact and there every week, but may bring in collaborators and my grad student advisees. I intentionally do not run a "lab", but I do have a "constellation of collaboration." Students can choose their own particular context in which LLMs are deployed and which kinds of community members / impacted people they want to consult.

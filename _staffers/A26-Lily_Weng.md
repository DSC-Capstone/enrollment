title: Trustworthy Machine Learning 
bio: Lily Weng is an Assistant Professor in the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego with affiliation in the CSE department.  Her research interest is in machine learning and deep learning, with primary focus on Trustworthy AI.
description: This capstone is expected to be fully research oriented project led by student teams. The topics includes: building interpretable deep learning models, automated mechanistic interpretability framework for deep vision models or large language models. Another potential topic is on the jailbreak attacks and other potential failure modes for LLMs. 
summer: For students to be successful in this session, they need to be able to understand the following papers and be able to set up the code repo successfully:
1. Concept Bottleneck Large Language Models: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.07992
2. Interpretable Generative Models through Post-hoc Concept Bottlenecks: https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19377
3. Iterative Self-Tuning LLMs for Enhanced Jailbreaking Capabilities: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.18469
time: maybe Mon or Fri afternoon
ta: Zoom
style: Students will form teams to conduct research projects. Student teams are expected to lead the research project. Students are expected to be proficient in pytorch and deep learning library, and have experience in setting up deep vision models and open sourced LLMs.

title: Hardware Acceleration of ML Algorithms
bio: Rajesh Gupta serves as a founding director of the Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute and as a distinguished professor of Computer Science and Engineering at UC San Diego. His research is in embedded and cyber-physical systems with a focus on sensor data organization and its use in optimization and analytics. Prof. Gupta holds Qualcomm Endowed Chair in Embedded Microsystems at UC San Diego and INRIA International Chair at the French international research institute in Rennes, Bretagne Atlantique. He is a Fellow of the IEEE, the ACM and the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
description: Machine Learning Acceleration using Hardware such as FPGA refers to design and implementation of hardware blocks that are useful in either acceleration of application codes (such as manipulation of graph neural networks) or in acceleration of architectural mechanisms (such as prefetches, memory assists etc). In this project you will explore use of architectural mechanics that substantially speedup the selected ML codes.
summer: Directed exploration, installation and use of necessary simulation tools for basic microarchitectures.
time: Wed 11-12 (Sat 11-12 is an option as well)
modality: In-person (will book own room)
ta: TBD
style: My mentoring is to listen your progress and plans on a weekly basis and lead you to think through alternatives.
seats: 6

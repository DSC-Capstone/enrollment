title: "Igniting Resilience: Unleashing Wildfire Mitigation Insights"
bio: "Kasra Mohammadi is a Data Scientist at San Diego Gas & Electric, working under the Risk Analytics team within the Wildfire Mitigation department, helping lead the company forward in its wildfire mitigation initiatives. Kasra is a fellow UCSD alum, having graduated from UCSD with bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering and went on to earn a master’s degree in data Analytics from Clarkson University. He has worked for several years within the wildfire mitigation and utility space where his focus has been on developing, optimizing, and managing various wildfire risk assessment and mitigation models and tools. Kasra joined SDG&E to focus on developing models to mitigate wildfire risk in California and has since continued to push the efficiency and quality of those models to help benefit the Wildfire Mitigation efforts pursued by SDG&E.

description: "In partnership with SDG&E's Wildfire Mitigation Team, students will embark on a pivotal journey to propel wildfire mitigation risk assessment forward by investigating the intricate connections between electrical assets, urban infrastructure, and environmental factors. This venture is pivotal for fostering a risk-informed and smarter tomorrow. By diving into real-world data from diverse sources such as snapshot-specific asset attribute data, ignition and outage event data, geospatial and environmental datasets, participants will utilize a suite of analytical tools including predictive modeling, graph theory, and time-series analysis to unearth insights. The endeavor will harness these analyses to pinpoint locations and assets that pose the highest risk of wildfire and relative and absolute severity of that risk. Additionally, projects will leverage predictive modeling techniques to forecast and prepare for future states of the electric system and the environment where change is the norm. Through this hands-on experience, students will not only contribute to San Diego's wildfire mitigation strategies but also develop valuable skills that echo the needs of a world class utility grid."

prerequisites: None
time: Thursdays 3pm-4pm, Hybrid, SDGandE
ta: Teresa Lee
style: "The student group will be a stand-alone unit at SDG&E led by Mentors. Mentors will first work with students to understand utility space, and then schedule time with other SDG&E staff who will provide tours, field visits, and other utility-specific training. Students will also be introduced to other data scientists and engineers at SDG&E who are available for support on an as-needed basis throughout the duration of the project. However, once an introduction is made, it will be up to the students to reach out to staff when support is needed. Students will be encouraged to present their ideas by staff members beyond the mentors."

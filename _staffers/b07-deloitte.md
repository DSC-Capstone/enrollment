description: "This class is for students interested in learning more about large language models and how to make them safe, secure, and private using robust guardrails.
 <br>
In the first quarter we will:<br>
- Briefly review the LLMs, benchmarking tools, and common enterprise applications<br>
- Discuss when GenAI breaks down and what we can do to mitigate these breakdowns<br>
- Review the most popular frameworks (Guardrails AI, NeMo, and LLM Guard) and architectures leveraged for guardrail implementations<br>
- Implement an enterprise application using one of the popular frameworks introduced<br>
By the end of the course, students can expect to implement a guardrail framework of their choice for their own GenAI application.
"
summer: "Research one implementation for any LLM guardrail and develop a 5 min presentation. Presentations will take place across the first four class sessions.<br> 
Examples to consider:<br>
-	From scratch implementation (OpenAI Cookbook)<br>
-	LLM Guard<br>
-	Guardrails AI<br>
-	NVIDIA NeMo Guardrails<br>
-	Tru Lens<br>
-	Agent-based modeling<br>
Please also shore up on the pre-requisites.

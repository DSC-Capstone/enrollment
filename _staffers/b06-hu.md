title: Large Language (Multi-Modal) Model Reasoning
bio: "Zhiting Hu is an Assistant Professor in Halicioglu Data Science Institute at UC San Diego. He received his Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Peking University in 2014, and his Ph.D. in Machine Learning from Carnegie Mellon University in 2020. His research interests lie in the broad area of machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and ML systems. In particular, he is interested in principles, methodologies, and systems of training AI agents with all types of experience (data, symbolic knowledge, rewards, adversaries, lifelong interplay, etc), and their applications in controllable text generation, healthcare, and other application domains. His research was recognized with best demo nomination at ACL2019 and outstanding paper award at ACL2016."
description: "A central topic in Large Language Model (LLM) research is to enhance their ability of complex reasoning on diverse problems (e.g., logical reasoning, mathematical derivations, and embodied planning). Rich research has been done to generate multi-step reasoning chains with LLMs, such as Chain-of-Thoughts (CoT), Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT), Reasoning-via-Planning (RAP), among others. This capstone aims to explore the diverse reasoning approaches of LLMs (and/or large multi-modal models) and investigate improvement, applications, and scalable implementations of these approaches. For example: (1) Proposing new reasoning algorithms or improvement over existing reasoning algorithms in terms of performance; (2) Developing algorithmic and/or system innovations to scale up existing advanced reasoning algorithms; (3) Applying the reasoning algorithms on new applications in various domains (e.g., chemistry, physics, medicine)."

prerequisites: Large language models; open-source tools such as huggingface
time: Tuesday 3-4PM, In-Person
style: Students can either join the mentor's research group to work closely with PhD students/postdocs on relevant projects, or propose their own ideas and lead the projects. Students are expected to be independent, and mentor will provide necessary advices if needed (PhD students/postdocs can also provide more hands-on guidances).

description: Blockchains provide a platform for developing new distributed programs and workflow that provide for various services. It is particularly suited for services that involved asynchronous collaboration of diverse actors (human or agents) to achieve overall system objectives. Among the key capabilities are verifiability, non-volatility/immutability of various transactions as well enforcements of various dependencies in a provably correct manner. In this capstone project, you will explore one such service, design and implement it using smart contracts on a chosen platform (Solidity/Ethereum, Solana, Hyperledger etc). You may also consider building upon past projects such as those for GymCoin, RealEstate, etc.
summer: Please study, review basics of Blockchain. Since the Smart Contract programming ecosystem is evolving, please research and practice with potential development platform for your project. You may look at the past projects for suggestions.

  The biotech and biomedical industries rely heavily on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy and safety of medical interventions, yet these trials are prohibitively expensive and time-consuming—costing an average of $1.3 billion per drug and spanning 10–15 years for market approval in the pharmaceutical sector. Similarly, preclinical animal testing adds significant financial and ethical burdens, with failure rates exceeding 85% when translating results to humans. In this proposal, we seek to address these inefficiencies by advancing digital twin technologies as a transformative paradigm in biomedical research and development.

  Digital twins—AI-driven computational replicas of physiological systems—have the potential to accelerate innovation by providing scalable, cost-effective, and ethically viable alternatives to conventional RCTs. They can simulate disease progression, predict patient responses to interventions, and enable in silico testing of therapeutics, reducing reliance on human and animal trials. However, major gaps hinder their widespread adoption, including (1) lack of standardized, generalizable representations of physiological systems across individuals and timescales, (2) computational inefficiencies in personalizing models for diverse populations, and (3) limited capacity for knowledge transfer between different interventions and treatment domains.

  This project aims to bridge these gaps by establishing foundational methods for scalable, personalized, and computationally efficient digital twins. Through advanced physiological modeling, knowledge graph integration, and large language model (LLM)-augmented frameworks, we will develop novel approaches to enhance prediction, personalization, and decision-support in biomedical innovation. Our proposed methods will not only improve the efficiency and reliability of digital twins but also provide a generalizable infrastructure applicable across diverse medical domains, including diabetes management, kidney dialysis, and substance use disorder interventions.

  To address these challenges, we propose three core research thrusts:  
  (i) Representation of Physiological Systems for Closed-Loop Modeling: We will develop featurization and representation learning techniques that generalize across diverse biomedical data types (from physiological signals to symptoms and comorbidities), ensuring adaptability across time scales (minutes to years) and population levels (individuals to cohorts).  
  (ii) Computationally Efficient Digital Twins with Personalization Mechanisms and Knowledge Graphs: We will design scalable, personalized digital twin models that dynamically identify similar individuals within a population to enhance forecasting accuracy for physiological states based on specific interventions. Additionally, we will integrate knowledge graphs to learn relationships between different interventions, allowing the model to extrapolate to novel treatment strategies.  
  (iii) Demonstration of a Generalizable Large Language Model (LLM)-Augmented Digital Twin Framework and Dashboard: We will implement and validate a scalable, interactive framework to support digital twin experimentation in multiple biomedical domains, including diabetes management, kidney dialysis, and substance use disorder interventions.

  I along with my PhD student will attend the meeting every week. My mentoring style is really to help you to know the right tools, help you to identify the intermediate goals and eventually ask challenging questions. Eventually the success will largely depend on you and your approach to tackle complex questions with lots of uncertainty. I want you to take leadership (almost consider this as an opportunity to write your paper or build your startup, just as an example) and I will be there to help you to navigate the complex landscape of uncertainty in research.

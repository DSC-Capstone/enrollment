title: Robust and Interpretable Neural Network Models for Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing
bio: "Lily Weng is an assistant professor in Halıcıoğlu Data Science Institute with affiliation to Computer Science and Engineering Department at UC San Diego. Her research vision is to make the next generation AI systems and deep learning algorithms more robust, reliable, explainable, trustworthy and safer. More details please see lilywenglab.github.io"
description: "The goal of this project is for students interested in robustness and interpretability for deep neural network models. Students will develop methods to improve robustness and interpretability of deep learning tasks such as computer vision and natural language processing."
summer: "If you are able to understand below papers and setup the code repo provided in below, then you are likely to succeed in this capstone project. If you have problems setting up the repo or/and understand the technical details in below papers, then this capstone session is very likely not a good fit for you. <br><br>

Please don't be discouraged, it only means that you require more background e.g. you are encouraged to take Prof. Weng's DSC 190 Trustworthy machine learning, also DSC 140A, DSC 140B, CSE 150-152, CSE 156.

prerequisites: DSC 140A, DSC 140B, DSC 190 Trustworthy Machine Learning, CSE 151A, CSE 151B, CSE 150A, CSE 150B, CSE 152A, CSE 152B, CSE 156
time: Monday 4-5PM, Zoom
ta: Shriniwas Kulkarni
style: This project will be purely research-oriented and heavier than the usual course project. Students are expected to lead their capstone project under Prof. Weng's guidance. Students who have successfully completed DSC 140B, and familiar with deep learning algorithms in computer vision or natural language processing, and deep learning libraries (e.g. pytorch) and neural networks are more likely to succeed in this project.

Utkrisht is an Applied Scientist at Amazon.com since 2022, specializing in Graph Machine Learning, NLP, and Computer Vision to detect high-velocity fraud events and cybersecurity threats in Amazon and AWS. Some of his innovations include web tracking of buyers and sellers in Amazon, generating billion-scale graphs of Amazon traffic, and spam protection for Amazon customers. Utkrisht is a San Diego local and completed his undergraduate degree (2017), master's degree (2019), and PhD (2022) all at UCSD. He also has a mini-MBA from the Rady School of Management, UCSD. During his PhD, Utkrisht conducted research on applying deep learning techniques to discover elusive mutations in cancer genomes. He has been a teaching assistant for courses at both undergraduate and graduate levels in the Computer Science and Bioengineering Departments. Outside of work, Utkrisht spends his time flying (he is a private pilot) and playing pickleball.

Thiago is a Sr. Applied Scientist at Amazon.com since 2018, working on a variety of topics such as large language models, recommendation systems, neural networks, de-biasing methodologies, causal inference, and ML Ops. Originally from Brazil, Thiago is a physicist by training, finishing his PhD on 2015 on mathematical modeling of biological neural networks. Since then, Thiago worked as a Postdoctoral fellow for UCSD on projects involving ML applied to neuroscience, systems biology, and finance. Thiago also taugh two graduate classes on big data for finance as visiting professor for the Rady School of Management, UCSD. In 2017, Thiago moved to UCLA where he was a Postdoctoral fellow and part of the Collaboratory where he created a 3-day intensive course on Machine Learning for biologists which continues until today. Outside work, Thiago spends most of his time playing music."
description: "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the next frontier in machine learning, designed to navigate the intricate web of connections in real-world data. They harness neural networks to unravel hidden patterns and insights buried within complex relationships, from social media graphs to molecular structures. GNNs are already making waves in fields like biology and drug discovery, transforming phenomena into graph structures to predict protein interactions and uncover new drug candidates. As the field evolves, we're exploring exciting frontiers like Graph Large Language Models, bringing the power of language models to graph-structured data. The primary objectives of this project (1) to comprehend biological complexities through the lens of machine learning and (2) to design and apply tailored GNN models to address intricate biological problems."

Familiarity with PyTorch, Tensorflow, Pandas, Networkx, Deep Graph Library"
oldstudent: nan
prerequisites: "Background in Genomics (basic), background in Neural Networks (training small feedforward networks/MLP)"
time: Thursday, 10am-11am, Hybrid, 336 HDSI
ta: Aritra Das
style: "For the first quarter, we will meet as one group to gain familiarity and confidence with the main concepts of precision Graph Neural Networks and its application to Genomics. For the second quarter, we will split into smaller groups which will independently build on top of the concepts developed in the first quarter. At the end of Quarter 1, we expect having a paper to be published in Re:Science. Students will work on publicly available datasets and will be doing all the analysis on their own. GitHub will be used as the primary channel to report results and progress. Students will be expected to know basic concepts of neural networks, such as how back-propagation works, how to change meta-parameters such as learning rate, etc. Students are not required to understand in details how Graph Neural Networks work, as will save time to study this topic in Quarter 1.

At the end of Quarter 1, we expect having a paper to be published in Re:Science.

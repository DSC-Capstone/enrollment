  SDSO struggles with underutilized bed space caused by complex classification restrictions. The existing manual or semi-automated decision-making process limits Jail Population Management Unit (JPMU)’s ability to respond quickly and accurately to changes in jail population demographics and availability. A more intelligent, automated system is required to streamline this process and improve overall efficiency.

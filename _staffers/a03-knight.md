title: Applying Transformer Models to Microbiome Data to Improve Human and Environmental Health
bio: "I grew up in New Zealand, and was always interested in biology and computers from a young age. I did a BSc in Biochemistry at the University of Otago in New Zealand, a PhD in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Princeton, and postdoctoral work at the University of Colorado. At UCSD, I am a Professor in 4 departments - HDSI, CSE, Bioeng, and Pediatrics, and I direct the Center for Microbiome Innovation. My highly interdisciplinary lab pioneers techniques for microbiome specimen analysis and data analysis, including in the Human Microbiome Project, the Earth Microbiome Project, and the American Gut Project/Microsetta."
description: "Did you know that more than half the cells in your body are bacteria, and at least 99% of the genes in your body are not from the human genome? We are discovering how the microbiome, all the microbes that inhabit us, are linked to different health conditions, ranging from inflammatory bowel disease to Alzheimer's disease and depression. We have been exploring different applications of transformer models to improve classification and regression of microbiome data with respect to patient or environmental variables, to identify novel antimicrobial agents (last year's project), to relate the microbiome to other data layers such as the metabolome or to brain imaging, and to incorporate the biomedical literature into systems that can make microbiome data accessible to physicians, patients, and citizen-scientists. We will explore the current space around the microbiome, pick a recent paper or preprint to replicate results from, and then explore a new iteration of the method or apply the method to a new dataset. Our microbiome analysis platform Qiita contains data from over half a million samples, so there are many potential questions to explore that could have a high impact."
summer: "Most recent projects have used PyTorch so familiarity with that is a good idea. My TED talk, although it pre-dates our use of AI, gives a sense of what we do and what the key questions are. https://www.ted.com/talks/rob_knight_how_our_microbes_make_us_who_we_are?language=en"

prerequisites: None
time: Wednesday 3-4PM, In-Person
style: Class will be assisted by graduate students and/or research staff in my lab who are experts in the domain and/or deep learning techniques to be applied. The first few weeks will be spent assessing what techniques this year's students are most excited about learning or applying, and refining a specific application area (e.g. a particular algorithm or disease or both). More independence typically leads to a more interesting project, but given the state of the field the ability to replicate results from a cutting edge paper and apply it to a new dataset that we have access to is perfectly acceptable. Prior knowledge of the microbiome, or even biology, is not expected - the goal is to learn something new!

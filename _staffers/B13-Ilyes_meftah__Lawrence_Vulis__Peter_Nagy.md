title: Wildfire and Property Intelligence Modeling with Cotality
bio: |
  Ilyes Meftah has been a data scientist and catastrophe modeler with Cotality for 13 years. With a strong background in mathematics and quantitative finance (holding multiple master's degrees from Paris, France universities), Ilyes has developed risk assessment models for wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes throughout his career. Recently, he has been focusing his efforts on quantifying wildfire mitigation measures to help communities located in high-risk areas. He is passionate about solving complex problems and sharing knowledge with others. When not working on catastrophe models, he enjoys hiking around the world with his family.

  Lawrence Vulis is a senior hazard scientist at Cotality, where he works on building physical and AI-based models of natural hazard risk to properties. Prior projects include machine learning-based classification of river delta geometry, satellite-based tracking of arctic lake spatiotemporal dynamics, linking satellite-derived beach dynamics with off-shore wave climate in Southern California, and a geospatial database/platform for machine learning-based permafrost mapping. His educational background is in Civil and Environmental Engineering, with a B.E. from The City College of New York and a Ph.D. from UC Irvine, with an extended internship and brief stint at Los Alamos National Lab. Outside of work he enjoys spending time with his wife and dog on beaches and trails.

  Peter Nagy has been with Cotality for 15 years, applying his passion toward big spatial data problems that occur with parcels, buildings, and geographic data relating to natural hazard risks. Prior experience includes the virtual earth (streetside) team with Microsoft, as well as multiple projects with Vexcel including SRTM processing, feature extraction from radar imagery, visualizations of raster and vector imagery like polarimetric SAR compositions, and building the RAMS Antarctic DEM. He studied at the University of Colorado in Boulder where he still lives, enjoying outdoor activities like hiking and skiing.

  This capstone will offer students the opportunity to select from three rich domains of applied data science in collaboration with Cotality:

  **Domain 1 — Wildfire Risk Intelligence: Advanced Modeling for Climate Resilience**  
  Students will enhance wildfire catastrophe models by designing machine learning models to simulate fire intensity within wildfire perimeters. Focus is on improving hazard modeling to support insurance pricing, emergency planning, and resilience.

  **Domain 2 — Wildfire Risk Intelligence: Statistical Modeling of Wildfire Frequency**  
  This project explores methods for assigning realistic event frequencies to wildfire footprints, matching historical damage patterns using statistical modeling and machine learning. It will provide exposure to risk quantification, spatial data processing, and policy-relevant analytics.

  **Domain 3 — Property Intelligence: Enhancing Geospatial Data Quality for Risk Assessment**  
  Students will apply machine learning to improve land use classification across county boundaries and enhance data quality in nationwide parcel-level property databases. The goal is to refine features used across catastrophe models and climate analytics platforms.

  Across all domains, students will engage in hands-on work with real datasets, industry tools (Python/R, GIS), and catastrophe modeling techniques. The outputs are intended to directly improve Cotality’s modeling platforms and have measurable real-world impacts.

  Our mentoring approach combines structure with creativity in a collaborative environment. Weekly sessions will balance technical guidance with hands-on problem-solving. Students will have opportunities to interact with multiple catastrophe modeling experts at Cotality, gaining exposure to different perspectives and specialized knowledge. We believe learning works best when it's engaging and enjoyable, so we'll incorporate real-world applications and team-based challenges throughout the project. While we'll provide regular guidance and feedback, we value student initiative and will encourage independent exploration of solutions within our project framework. Our goal is to create an experience that's both intellectually stimulating and professionally valuable.

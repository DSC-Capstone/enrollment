description: |
  A comprehensive disease knowledge base integrates ICD-10, WHO classifications, MeSH terms, and rare disease registries to enable standardizing disease definitions including subtypes, phenotypic variations and evolving classifications; and reduces ambiguity in electronic health records (EHRs), genomic studies, and real-world evidence (RWE) analysis.

However, challenges persist due to

* Heterogeneous disease nomenclatures (e.g., "Type 2 Diabetes" vs. "T2DM" vs. "NIDDM")
* Inconsistent hierarchical mappings (e.g., autoimmune disorders, cancer subtypes)
* Sparse or conflicting annotations for rare diseases
* Manual curation bottlenecks in updating ontologies (e.g., ICD-11 transitions)

AI-assisted data curation addresses these gaps by automating

* Semantic Labeling & Tagging: AI-assisted labeling & tagging of disease names, synonyms, and subtypes from unstructured text (EHRs, literature) help to both organize data and automate repetitive Human In the Loop feedback. Additionally, AI-driven Data Sampling for Model training will overcome challenges related to class imbalance and scarcity of labeled data.
* Hierarchical Classification: Machine learning models to map diseases to standard ontologies (ICD, SNOMED, MONDO) and infer subtype relationships.
* Conflict Resolution: Disambiguating overlapping terms (e.g., "ALS" as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis vs. Advanced Life Support).

Expected Project deliverables - 
1. Ontology Mapping with detailed data dictionary and schema documentation
2. Rules and Analysis conducted for data cleanup for conflicts / outliers
3. Demo of the work including models and data stores used i.e., SQL, No-SQL, Vector DB etc., architecture stack, and training methodology
4. Documentation i.e., pseudo / source code, model performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) for semantic labeling and hierarchical classification
